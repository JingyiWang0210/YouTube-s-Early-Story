Britanniafb,Britanniafb,"The Band was formed in 1975 in the village of Cambuslang, just outside Glasgow, and is proud to have taken part in Parades and Contests throughout Scotland, England & Ulster. In Britain today we perceive an orchestrated campaign against Protestants in selected corners of the British Isles. This has taken the form of both cultural and physical genocide. We would urge Loyalists not to be lulled into any false sense of security. In the face of injustice, speak out - no-one will do it for you

caltonmedia,caltonmedia,"PULSE Profile: PULSE is primarily an information resource and advice service. However, PULSE and the associated discussion forums, chat rooms and Calton Radio section of the site, make up the most intensely active corner of Protestant Loyalist and Unionist web space. The intensity and frequency of discussion on the forums suggests that this website has become an important focus for a significant proportion of the PUL community. The role of PULSE, in organising events, sponsoring bands, hosting band websites and Dances since its conception on March the 17th 2004 provides evidence that online activity has become woven in with the Protestant, Unionist and Loyalist scene.

PULSEMedia is a sizeable collective of Loyalist and Patriotic filmmakers dedicated to highlighting the plight of the victims of Irish Republican terrorism.

We support the global war on terrorism and our troops fighting tyranny in Afghanistan and Iraq alongside our American friends.

starlitshores,Starlitshores,"Some suggested that my mother have an abortion but she did not and so I am alive today. 
My story is expressed in my video ""Morning Has broken: Abortion and Pro-life"" 
Abortion stops a beating heart thousands of times per day. A human heart starts beating 18-24 days after conception.
I am not condemning anyone who has had an abortion, I do not have the authority to judge them. 

All I am saying is that the life and the soul of a baby in the womb is precious, he or she means something in this world, and we should think twice before taking that life away. What was his or her life suppose to be? What does her life mean now? What was the baby suppose to learn? Who was she suppose to affect? 
We don't have the wisdom to stop her beating heart, stop the life the surges through her. Peace.",1240,3280539,43,1742
