TH47VXU41RA,2006-12-23 20:13:38+00:00,"The US sees Israel as a country... And we're more powerful than the EU, so that's one more reason to hate America and feel self-righteous. Enjoy!"
TH47VXU41RA,2006-12-12 21:49:35+00:00,"The UN is anti Israel.  I will tell you this.  The Zionist state (I say this because I am proud to be a zionist) will last forever because of people like myself who refuse to go, and specifically support and visit the areas that they want to give away.  If we want me to go you will have to do a lot more than say leave."
TH47VXU41RA,2006-12-12 21:22:06+00:00,"One thing about Hitler, we do not want his name erased, may his name live forever, so we can all remember his horrible deeds, and so we may once again realize that history repeats itself... Seen the latest marches of the Hizzballah? Not too long ago the Nazzi armi looked exactly the same way, sadly enough they're doing it for the same purpose."
TH47VXU41RA,2006-11-30 22:32:13+00:00,"Most people dont understand the past hundred year history  of the region and are only really told about partial bits ( normally from anti-zionist ), also that until very recently Israel has been quite literally fighting for its very excistance- for example of this Egypts attack and the president of Iran saying he wanted Israel to be ""Whiped of the map""."
TH47VXU41RA,2006-11-23 20:43:36+00:00,What a load of Danish singing crap.
TH47VXU41RA,2006-11-21 20:53:21+00:00,"I see this stuff, and it makes me cry.yut themselves in front of Israeli Army operations.  They see it like they are dying for Allah.  They have no regard for human life.  They target civillians and they use their own as human shields.  We are such a small country surrounded by enemies and the world just wants to exterminate us.  I guess not a lot has changed since Hitler may his name be erased"
TH47VXU41RA,2006-11-16 20:24:01+00:00,the song is by outlandish

txqn86oEn58,2007-08-14 04:33:01+00:00,August 20 is Ron Pauls 72nd birthday. Please send him a generous donation of at least $72. Or how about $1776!
txqn86oEn58,2007-07-31 03:10:04+00:00,"This song is by Pokerface from Allentown, PA. Check e'm out at pokerface. com. Great political protest rock. Alright, I'm from PA and I love 'em what can I say? Go Ron Paul!"
txqn86oEn58,2007-07-19 12:25:31+00:00,"GGed = good gamed, like when Ron Paul held that press conference educating Adolph Guiliani he GGed Guiliani."
txqn86oEn58,2007-07-05 15:00:08+00:00,"I saw that interview and I don't see how you think Ron Paul folded or flip-flopped on his beliefs. Cavuto kept trying to get the conversation going in a certain direction and Ron Paul wouldn't let him do it. Your perception of that interview is really distorted. I think you're a Rudy McRomney supporter. Here's a video from 2004 w/Ron Paul saying to do away with the IRS.

txqn86oEn58,2007-06-03 02:17:20+00:00,"As Paul of PokerFace tells me there have been offers from labels but at a price way too high.. They must change the message. No patriotic music.. What the hell happened to this country.....  

We will take back Control and the New World Order will die... One way or another... I would rather die than be their slave.. We can do this peacefully or we can do it Old School..  Your choice Neo-Cons."
txqn86oEn58,2007-06-02 21:44:31+00:00,I think it's great that someone used Pokerface's music for a Ron Paul promotional video. Good matchup.  Don't take the chip and keep fighting the New World Order!
txqn86oEn58,2007-06-02 21:44:05+00:00,"Pokerface is awesome! All go to Pokerface<dot>com and order ""Sex, Lies, and Politics"" and ""Made in America"". Both CD's are loaded with great songs. They do it all themselves because no record label will touch them. Their message is way too controversial. However, their CD's also feature very striking artwork, interactive computer content and are ""better than the majors"" in  almost all aspects.  New one should be coming out in a few months - I can't wait!"

Especially during the bridge, where you added all of the lying presstitute organizations party to the cover up and lies  destroying our nation today, and trying their best to keep out Ron Paul of the rest of the debates. Because they are running scared, that if enough Americans wake up, their New World Order could collapse over night.
Power to the people.

CjuYKmV9hig,2007-07-03 05:08:19+00:00,How did Taylor let it slip? He didn't say anything about him having a baby
gZ4BBqLLCjc,2006-10-23 22:38:16+00:00,omg doy you think that is somthig intresting or funny? i dont  think so
gZ4BBqLLCjc,2006-10-22 01:04:36+00:00,this is shit
h9IpvUSPjOA,2007-09-13 20:30:04+00:00,Animal cruelty will remain as long as ignorance does. And i do not believe that "God" gave us animals to eat. IF this "God" gave us anything it wa sa brain to understand that eating animals is wrong.
h9IpvUSPjOA,2007-08-10 01:07:17+00:00,Oh that's right we OWN animals they do belong to US. "God" made them for us. I remember when God told me that it was okay to skin live animals because he made them for me anyways. God likes to see animals suffer for OUR sake.
h9IpvUSPjOA,2007-04-13 21:36:46+00:00,"I hope I can continue to inspire people to get out and do something. There are SO many issues to be tackled, we can all take one and run with it. I don't want to hear any shit about PETA either... They have done a lot of good. :) Plus they have supplies!"
h9IpvUSPjOA,2007-04-07 05:20:21+00:00,"PETA, eh?  Those guys have cost me a lunch or two... but I have to admit, they get the message across.

There is nothing in the world that I approve of more heartily than social activism.  No-one will ever be able to say that you were asleep at the wheel during your watch.  I wish we could say that of more people."
h9IpvUSPjOA,2007-04-07 00:27:20+00:00,"youre proof that people can make a difference. its inspiring. BUT, with that said, if i drove by you on the street and you were protesting...i dont think i would have been reading the sign ;) JK
Keep up the great work and keep on inspiring us all."
bhK5wLAEWy8,2007-07-30 13:52:04+00:00,"Attende, there is a jewish language called 'lashon hakodesh', the language in which the bible is written, which indeed very much resembles hebrew, but its not hebrew."
bhK5wLAEWy8,2007-05-26 22:44:26+00:00,Sorry.  I misunderstood.
bhK5wLAEWy8,2007-05-26 09:54:30+00:00,I wrote just that. Basch84 wrote at his page linked above 'Jewish' language and I wrote him that it is not Jewish but Hebrew and hence 'Jewish' language does not exist.
bhK5wLAEWy8,2007-05-25 11:53:02+00:00,"Ken, atah.  And it is not the Jewish language.  It is Hebrew, fool."

tGg6nu_tm3U,2007-10-15 08:33:59+00:00,"Honestly, when she was asked about being the focal point of the band... it's true. The band is good, however, the rhythm and melody is very simple and not diverse whatsoever. Without Hayley the band would be like any other band. ClichÃ©. Because of her she gives uniqueness and power. It's not because she is a girl, but the fact that guys find her attractive, it's more about how amazing her voice is at that age."
tGg6nu_tm3U,2007-10-07 18:55:32+00:00,eh.. pridstar>shes not naturally ginger ya know! she's naturally a dark blonde.she dyes it red.

G-d told you nothing. You've been in the hallucinogenics again. G-d spoke to several prophets (Mohamed wasn't one of them), and gave us His word through the Torah. And in it, He says He chose us above all nations to be His special people."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 02:50:32+00:00,"G-d has His reasons. We don't always know them. Perhaps it's because we must earn everything He gives us by exhibiting faith in Him and doing it ourselves. And when we obey Him, we ARE invulnerable. It is only when we disobey Him that we are vulnerable, but still indestructible. Last time you checked, we were slaughtered by Hitler? Then you haven't checked in 62 years. The surrounding enemies are only a threat if we disobey Him. And sometimes, yes, He requires us to kill."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 02:31:57+00:00,"Hey, it says what it says. You said, ""If u want Him to love u again let Palestine have it's [sic] freedom & land back."" I'm just showing you what G-d demands of us. You wanna argue about its justification? We can do that another time. First let's understand what G-d demands of us. And it's not love thy enemy, and all that other lovey-dovey crap. He gave us the land. If anyone else wants to live there, they have to agree to certain conditions. If not, they must go.
""anti peace"" lol."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 02:18:23+00:00,"I never said that (""the Quran is consisting of evil and directions to kill others [sic]""). I really don't care what the Quran says. It makes no difference to me whether it's nice flowery gibberish, or mean evil gibberish. It's gibberish. And we don't bitch about terrorism. We simply point to it to explain why the IDF must do what it does. Personally, I don't think we should explain anything. Like I said before, our explanations are better understood when dropped from an F-16."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 02:09:45+00:00,"The Torah is the word of the One G-d, Who controls the universe. You can accept that, leave us in peace, and be rewarded; or you can reject it, go to war with us, and become a nation of shahids. Either way works fine for us."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 02:03:56+00:00,"First and foremost, I never said no one can defy Allah's will. I said no one can defy the will of the G-d of Israel. Big difference.

Secondly, you don't get to decide what's economically sensible for G-d. He told us in Leviticus 26:44-45 (which is quoted elsewhere on this page), and several other places, that He would never abandon us. We are His chosen people forever.

And enough already with your garbage filled Quran. I already told you, it's gibberish."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-13 01:52:13+00:00,"There's that OCD again. After all this time, you repeat the same question I've answered countless times.

I'm a Jew, and that makes Israel mine. You want me to prove G-d said so? Read the quotes from the Torah, that I provided all over this page. Or better yet, read the Torah. And if you don't believe the Torah's authenticity, well then that's just too bad.  Israel is mine."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-11 18:37:28+00:00,"Where does it say that we were not allowed to come back??? The second exile had a predestined time (70 years). The current one has a predestined MAXIMUM time (not revealed to us), which is known as ""B'Itah."" But there is no predestined minimum. The redemption can come at any moment (Achi-Shenah). Herzl has nothing to do with this. He didn't start Zionism, he merely made it popular, and for all the wrong reasons. Israel is mine, because G-d said so, not Herzl."
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-11 17:57:18+00:00,"Exodus 34:12 -- ""Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, that you are coming into: Lest they be for a snare in your midst."""
6myF6ZlEpo4,2007-05-11 17:49:04+00:00,"Here's what G-d doesn't favor: And if you will not expel the inhabitants of the land from before you -- then shall those that you let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes and as pricks in your sides; and they shall harass you on the land wherein you dwell. And it shall be, that as I thought to do unto them -- I will do unto you."" (Num 33:55-56)"

C3mq590Fv2k,2007-10-30 17:41:17+00:00,"only democratic country in africa was south africa once, but we all know what kind of racist democracy it was.
as long as israel have jewish only places and streets, its just a bs racist country wich needs to be boycoted like south africa was in the 80s."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-10-22 02:54:25+00:00,some muslims are okay and some are bad. The ones that are taught to kill for allah are bad.  And people have to protect themself against them
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-10-16 06:58:33+00:00,"Free Palestine? that's an oxymoroan like hot ice; there already 22 a-rab countries; none is free, in ME only democratic country is Israel."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-10-01 23:26:45+00:00,"Actually, it didn't call for a complete withdrawal, it simply called for a withdrawal, and the drafters realized that it was a bad idea to call for a complete withdrawal.

I know, Jimmy Carter said it, so it must be true, but there's a reason that Carter is considered the worst president in history."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-10-01 09:26:55+00:00,"As I've said before, and maybe you just can't read, or maybe the concept couldn't pierce your thick skull, but the resolution specifically avoided mention of the Armstice lines."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-28 21:54:11+00:00,"The resolutions clearly call on the Arab states to make peace with Israel. The principal condition is that Israel withdraw from ""territories occupied"" in 1967, which means that Israel must withdraw from some, all, or none of the territories still occupied. Since Israel withdrew from 91% of the territories when it gave up the Sinai, it has already partially, if not wholly, fulfilled its obligation under 242."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-27 22:34:24+00:00,"Well, then, the PAlestinians need to give someone with whom negotiations can be made."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-27 03:00:31+00:00,"The ultimate goal of 242, as expressed in paragraph 3, is the achievement of a ""peaceful and accepted settlement."" This means a negotiated agreement based on the resolution's principles rather than one imposed upon the parties."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-26 21:06:31+00:00,"The resolution doesn't call for Israel to pull out of Palestine completely, they realize that that would be a bad idea."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-26 17:17:19+00:00,"What law?

As usual, you've misinterpretted the law."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-25 21:37:37+00:00,Did you even read my response? They called the armstice line a rotten line. They said that it would be wrong to use that as a border.
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-25 19:56:43+00:00,"For example, Lord Caradon, the chief architect of the resolution, explained: ""We could have said: well, you go back to the 1967 line. But I know the 1967 line, and it's a rotten line. ... Had we said that you must go back to the 1967 line, which would have resulted if we had specified a retreat from all the occupied territories, we would have been wrong."""
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-25 19:56:29+00:00,"Resolution 242 calls on Israel to withdraw from territory in exchange for peace, but does not specify the extent of that withdrawal. The drafters of 242 have repeatedly explained why it is worded in that way."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-25 03:48:42+00:00,"Israel does not have codefied ethical laws.
Secondly, Israel has offered to remove all military personnel and settlers if the Palestinians will agree to peace.
And the UN does not recognize the green line as a border, they agree that it was an aweful border, that's why they specifically didn't mention it in resolution 242."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-24 18:52:52+00:00,"So, all Israelis are war criminals? Sounds like someone is an idiot."
C3mq590Fv2k,2007-09-23 05:59:20+00:00,"Hey, I have to agree with you on this one, if the TERRORISTS were to only target factories, then Israel would be willing to put up with the attacks, it would harm their economy, sure, but at least their citizens aren't being murdered anymore.

But we all know that the terrorists won't do that."
cdjqeNWJ5n8,2007-11-25 01:43:12+00:00,"It's to my understanding that Israel was created after WWII, in compensation for the Holocaust(one of the reasons anyway).  I have two questions...what did Palestine have to do with the Holocaust?  If Israel was created as compensation...shouldn't it have been established in Germany?"
cdjqeNWJ5n8,2007-10-24 15:03:53+00:00,"This video illustrates why Pal's will never establish a state, they kill & die lie & cry. rokets were thrown over Israely settlements immediatly after it left Gaza, the Israely goverment tried hard  to restrain saying to the public that it's temporry but eventually when it didn't stop had to retaliate allways warning civillians first!. Pal's you'll never build a state if you keep on lieing to the world & yourself."

Skip ahead to the mid-'80s and rediscovered it. Early '90s learned of the active ragtime scene. Now I'm a reasonably known ragtime composer (though better known for the videos of ragtime performers that I post on YouTube!)."

I went on to become very interested in health and became a Registered Dietitian...however I am now retired. I always enjoy your stories Peter!  Keep them coming!

If you listened to some real hip-hop i'm sure you would like it. It's looked at very wrongly by most the public. I recommend some.

Common
Mos Def

a_im9VcgVWo,2007-02-18 05:10:57+00:00,"Lots of Rap degrades women from what I can hear. Don't think you'd like most of it. By the way, I have a friend who acts/plays and plays just like Gene Krupa the Fastest Jazz Drummer in the World. His name is Randy Caputo. He is one the internet."

_4xLOUvyZuc,2007-08-18 23:34:15+00:00,"You are right - that is more a poem than a song. And a beautiful poem it is, too! I GREATLY look forward to hearing you interpret it to music!

Will I be able to buy that CD so that I can give it to my soon-90-year-old inlaws for Christmas, do you think? HOPE SO!"

I'll never forget that when I uploaded my first ever video (an attempt at vlogging in which I called you the Michael Parkinson/David Attenborough etc of YouTube) you were the first person to actually send a personal message commenting on it. Meant a lot back then. (I later deleted that video though.. uh because of low self-esteem? :P)  Anyways, YOU'RE THE GREATEST, thanks for being who you are :)"

_4xLOUvyZuc,2007-08-16 07:43:05+00:00,"just kind of an odd observation but the picture of you seems more lifelike in this video, like you're actually right there instead of just on youtube.  Maybe a camera upgrade or something.  Really enjoy your videos."
_4xLOUvyZuc,2007-08-16 05:27:37+00:00,"Peter,

You are a gentleman and a scholar.  It is a wonderful thing to see you here from day to day.  It really is amazing to see how this website has captured the hearts of so many people.  Good luck, may God bless you richly...we will see you at your 2nd anniversary!"

_4xLOUvyZuc,2007-08-16 05:10:21+00:00,"Hi Peter,  How wonderful to hear that yoiu are going to do a song.  And what a song it is.  One of Alan Parson classics, ""Old and Wise"".  It is a perfect fit and I can't wait to hear your version.  There are a number of youtube video's with the original version from the album and one or two from live performances.  I am excited for you.  Best wishes, my friend."

_4xLOUvyZuc,2007-08-15 15:32:56+00:00,I still remember the first time I saw you on youtube.God that was a whole year ago...
Aomv5EtXA44,2007-11-21 18:00:37+00:00,Pretty Cool.  Mixing instruments and styles to spread God's word out! Too bad DC Talk no longer exists (they're on their own each one with a career). Thanx for posting!
A6I0uI_iMsQ,2007-12-27 19:41:42+00:00,It's in B. They tune their guitars down a half step.
A6I0uI_iMsQ,2007-11-01 22:05:01+00:00,What most people don't know is that Rivers' and co. aren't playing it in the original key that the Foo Fighters have it in (being the key of C).
A6I0uI_iMsQ,2007-08-06 12:00:13+00:00,They sang this song in Phoenix too.  Their show was AWESOME!
A6I0uI_iMsQ,2007-05-23 18:27:42+00:00,"I am a huge weezer fan, saw them on this tour.... foo fighters blew them out of the water"

A6I0uI_iMsQ,2007-04-01 16:13:26+00:00,"nice video, Rivers is the man!"
KBcFLMSFfaQ,2007-12-28 18:04:22+00:00,They should totally put this on an album
cZH4mVNL-HM,2007-12-27 22:14:41+00:00,i listen to this song all the time
ySBrPvDCy3k,2007-09-28 06:56:30+00:00,These people are indeginous Papua New Guineans....from africa...maybe ...from Aborogini...maybe...from the moon...MAYBE!
ySBrPvDCy3k,2007-09-22 02:32:42+00:00,"It's funny how you are black when whites want you to be black and not black when they don't want you to be black. Like they are fucking color monitors. when you are not black they go by genetics,when you are black they go by your skin. White people are funny."
ySBrPvDCy3k,2007-08-17 12:15:04+00:00,The oldest humans look like Africans but with blond hair...the original true ones.
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-12-31 05:53:12+00:00,"and also, the music echos the ills of a culture who's ills are created by the issues that were stated in the first post. So that's my 2 cents there."
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-12-31 05:46:22+00:00,"These are the things that never get any attension because it's always the music, entertainment and the arts that are used as a scapegoat. I think that there needs to be a more direct focus on these issues because they're pretty much the sole causes of a lot of problems out there. Music is just a vent on releasing these negative emotions than a destructive way with no optimisstic end. So it's not the music that made the culture, it's the culture that mades the music"
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-12-31 05:35:08+00:00,"Interesting video series. All I can say is that there are far more important issues that need to be dealt with. Music rather satanic and neutral is only harmless escapeism, that is all. For those who are effected by it, it's more of issues that need to be revolved like poverty, broken homes, rejection, unheathly background, internal or external problems, abuse, weakness, loss, anger issues, religious oppression and just being constantly run down by people, life and all its ills."
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-12-05 23:18:26+00:00,I really don't think any of the people who post the comments felt differently before they watched the video. Neither did I. I still love rock music and there is no doubt in my mind that without i would still be going to hell. I did find this video really entertaining. You've captured my two favorite 80's songs Missionary Man Eurythmics and The Blood The Cure. Also a huge zeppelin fan. Not a fan of Wicca but a fan of original pagansim.

The ressurection of this plot of satan has now infultrated Hip Hop lets be on guard saints the end is near! Christ is King, every knee shall bow and tounge confess that JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!"
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-11-17 06:49:38+00:00,"I watched all 18 tapes and enjoyed it and learned from it. Thanks, I will be more careful as to what music I get into."
gaSjRkU0wXE,2007-11-17 01:45:32+00:00,and what makes u think that the music is true?

Theres a lot of Christian bands out there that is hard rock, we should listen to them to be blessed. God bless u all.."

It's okay to listen to hard rock music,but be sure it's not a devils instrument.."

NkCZI3eBLa8,2007-09-13 09:43:29+00:00,Rock is not causing people to kill themselves but if the person is already fragile such lyrics may turn them onto killing themselves lets not kid ourselves if someone is depressed they are not thinking rationally.
NkCZI3eBLa8,2007-06-24 05:03:01+00:00,Rock creating drugs is NOT true. Mind altering substances have been around since the beginning of time. It wasn't even illegal until the Prohibition era of the early 20th century.

I saw Hallucinations (Peter Wolf's act before J. Geils), The Velvets (a lot), Bonzo Dog Band, tons of other bands... At Lansdown St Tea Part I saw The Who, Beautiful Day, The Flock, more... it's a blur. The Velvets were so weird, but so good..."
669cvXlW4dc,2007-10-31 18:00:25+00:00,"wow - so rare, a live cut of this song. They were SO amazing live. Lou Reed was always a trip in this band, so extreme to this day. I don't know how many times I saw them... 10, 15? at the Boston Tea Party on Berlekey Street. They were always amazing."
669cvXlW4dc,2007-10-31 04:33:02+00:00,"for me, ""venus in furs"" ranks with ""kashmir"" and ""comfortably numb"" as one of those chilling, otherworldly classics that sounds as new and revolutionary now as the day it was released.  velvet underground's massive influence alone on indie rock over the last 40 years has to put them in the 10 all-time best. for me, they're at the top."
669cvXlW4dc,2007-08-22 00:17:32+00:00,the song is based on the book 'venus in furs' by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch.
669cvXlW4dc,2007-08-19 02:52:00+00:00,it's about sadomaschiasm
669cvXlW4dc,2007-08-18 12:58:27+00:00,The studio version with Reed on vocals an Cale on violin is far better.

669cvXlW4dc,2007-07-15 03:29:15+00:00,"it's john cale on vocals - why, idon't know - perhaps mr.reed was not up to singing on this live performance - anyone have any info?"

Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-11-14 22:16:54+00:00,imo the beginning is the only good part of the song.
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-11-11 20:59:49+00:00,It's an Epiphone. The thing costs Â£280. Not THAT expensive.
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-10-19 01:16:14+00:00,very nice. youre one of the few people on here that have that song right.

Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-24 23:58:59+00:00,I have seen two versions of the intro of this song. One is around the 2nd - 7th fret range and the other one is in this vid. Personally i think they sound the same but which one is the right one ?
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-22 21:22:38+00:00,"yeah i cant play guitar for shit, but it sounds really cool. i play drumss"
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-22 20:08:22+00:00,like the sound ur guitar produces
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-20 20:09:47+00:00,"Unfortunately, it's an Epiphone Korina X. I'd rather have the Gib but this one does the job pretty well."

Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-10 19:56:30+00:00,awsome playing!
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-09-08 08:12:19+00:00,"i think, thats the right way to play it. for the first arpeggio! 
listen to the record... the change between the highest a and b is OPEN! so you have to play like this.
when du choose the 5th-fret-variation, it is not open. 
but i got one good reason to change after this open-thing: the bass-notes and the bending are sounding much better, when you play in low fret position, i think. have you tried, mbengtsson? (Please write me a youtube mail... i'm interested in that!)"
Z1zUySlX5lk,2007-08-31 00:23:43+00:00,yeah srry i was thinking an E but its an E shape hes doing an Am which is what the bar is

GElC1xcBNKc,2007-06-11 00:50:08+00:00,"It was actually written by an American. Gerry and the Pacemakers use it. I thought it was re-done by an Irish band before them though, which is why Celtic use it."
GElC1xcBNKc,2007-06-08 14:18:10+00:00,it is a liverpool song-it was written by gerry and the pacemakers for liverpool football club. everyone else just steals it. but liverpool have proved that it only works for them! YNWA LFC

Alright, both are great bands and i think the only reason that this argument started and goes on is because of that they both wear masks and their band numbers are similar.

TcXpbaAiMZM,2007-11-19 20:40:19+00:00,"Well, I think an arrangement allows some changes, not only ""remove"" notes. It sounds good, then perfect. People likes it!"
TcXpbaAiMZM,2007-11-16 16:46:48+00:00,"Then, what are supposed to be those notes that aren't in the original song if not invented? :S"

f72029iNJhY,2007-06-17 02:13:46+00:00,"I'm glad they're doing this, because I think they inspire lots of fans around the nation. I just wish that people stopped worrying about stupid issues and see that the human race alone is KILLING an ENTIRE planet that is 19204769 times our size (ok I don't know the actual ratio =). It's rediculous to think that only 6 billion people can kill an entire planet."

And all I shall say about electric cars is that they need electricity to run; ever wonder where does this electricity is coming from?

Damn, where's cold fusion when you need it?"
f72029iNJhY,2007-05-14 16:21:08+00:00,Bus is a fucking prick and he is the one that is realy killing the planet not global warming.

f72029iNJhY,2007-04-12 22:02:12+00:00,hybrids help because they dont use nearly the same  amount of oil as normal cars. the gaol is to get everyone to buy hybrid cars so they would stop selling cars that use up so much oil.
f72029iNJhY,2007-04-12 21:49:46+00:00,"actually, america isnt to blame for bush becoming president again. more people voted for john kerry or whatever his name was. it was all up to congress. what happend was Congress ignored what the people wanted. unfortunatly they can do that."

f72029iNJhY,2007-04-12 20:54:12+00:00,not really. bunch of teenies only thought that song was a catchy and only listend to it cuz in was "in" i guess green day just wants to make it clear that bush is not a good president.
f72029iNJhY,2007-04-12 20:47:17+00:00,"i know. green day is a pretty powerfull band. if he wanted to, billie joe could convince millions of kids to take on the white house."

(just cuz tre didnt say anything) but i agree with them. all the people who think that global warrming is bullshit your life is a lie and it is also bullshit cuz global warming is happening. were killing ourselves and you all need to think about it

Just like people listen to George W. Bush but he IS A LIAR. Please do me and other green day fans a favour - don't say things like those. They're untrue. You know that."
f72029iNJhY,2007-02-11 23:56:31+00:00,I'm sorry to tell Green day but Oil companies profit margins are at the National industrial average. Also why does the goverment need to do anything. If people want to be less depandant on oil then make life style changes on your own.
f72029iNJhY,2007-02-07 01:29:25+00:00,These guys have really impressed me and I'm behind em 110% percent

f72029iNJhY,2006-12-09 04:39:53+00:00,ok fine but driving hybrids is not saving our planet goddamit. instead of advertizing hybrid cars they should be saying that the government invest in alternate sources of energy like geothermal or solar ore other stuff they have. thats what the real answer has to be. hybrids STILL RUN ON GAS so they dont change much when fast growing countries like china are buying mad amounts of oil too. lots of people who buy hybrids think theyre saving the planet and its kind of annoying.

o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-10-15 21:09:52+00:00,"I think it's great what they're doing, because now they are reaching out to a younger audience who can be aware of how we are corrupting ourselves, our world, and the generations world to come."
o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-09-16 10:10:20+00:00,great as always...that is really something to care of...
o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-09-14 17:26:45+00:00,"i really admire what theyre doing :D cos like flirtingwithinsantiy said, people are going to pay attention to such a well known and respected band like themselves  and if all their fan base joins them its just a matter of time before it spreads among other bands fans and hopefully evreyone will take them serously"
o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-08-18 07:03:41+00:00,"Then again, if we took 100 square miles of land and input a conglomeration of 70% effecient solar powered sterling engines, windmills, and solar towers, it can run the entire US. So I don't know."
o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-08-18 06:58:08+00:00,So we can slow down the rate of pollution but we will eventually reach oblivion. Eliminating human pollution completely without distrupting scientific progression and the steady growth of population is like discovering perpetual energy which is impossible.
o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-08-18 06:57:59+00:00,"I don't know, I think it is rather impossible for humans to completly stop pollution, but to only reduce the rate or amount of pollution created through an extended period of time since humans undoubtibly live off resources. It's inenvitable that the resources we use will become waste and that the ever growing population of people will only contribute to it further unless you take their right to bear more than one child."

o-qxG0Uvs5Y,2007-07-31 15:04:25+00:00,"Great video. Check out what the EPA called the ""most energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective"" systems available.  Geothermal heat pumps burn no fossil fuels, are 5 times more efficient than gas furnaces, and reduce utility bills up to 70%. 

It's equal to planting 750 trees or taking 2 cars off the road... Forever. If 10% of California goes geo, the energy saved equals the output of 9 power plants! Geo could have a huge impact on the environment and dependence on foreign oil."

did they kick him out or what?"

marAJawq_4g,2007-03-31 00:44:47+00:00,I love Eric and he knows it. lol!!! He moves around cause that is his style and you have to be unique. It's his style and i hope he moves around even more. :)
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-30 22:32:10+00:00,thanks!  I see Nelson Rangell everySunday in Denver with his Str8 ahead quartet    that dude is so cerebral with his playing  he makes me want to quit sometimes
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-21 03:42:33+00:00,I think i have actually.
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-21 02:01:05+00:00,have you heard some Cannonball play with this Bossa Nova Sextet   that dude is so sick
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-21 00:11:26+00:00,That's awesome!
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-20 22:06:50+00:00,No I'm not.  I have heard this cat live several times and we have a producer in common.  just because cats choose the more pop oriented style of jazz doesnt mean they CANT play.  Being a "smooth jazz" artist myself I can understand the attack on the music from the str8 ahead side due to the watered-down music being put out there right now.  However a lot of us respect understand and were influenced by the masters.  Dont hate Eric can play on both ends of the fence  I have heard him....
marAJawq_4g,2006-12-19 23:04:22+00:00,"cannonball is the best. Cannonball, Charlie, Carter, Woods, Brecker, Coltrane, Young, Hawkins, etc...i agree, garrett is better then this guy, but i dont like him too much. =\"
marAJawq_4g,2006-10-18 08:48:50+00:00,Who's better Mike Phillips or Eric Darius?
marAJawq_4g,2006-10-05 19:12:21+00:00,"Most people associate YOUR jazz with an older crowd. So much skill, to bad it's wasted with Walgreens Jazz."
marAJawq_4g,2006-09-10 13:42:27+00:00,Ew....giving cannonball a bad name with smooth jazz.
marAJawq_4g,2006-08-25 00:08:10+00:00,You sound great! Have fun and enjoy!

h0FtQsJJwpk,2007-02-19 21:12:44+00:00,Does anyone have 'I Run'?
adHRfM5hWGY,2007-10-29 17:26:11+00:00,"Why would anyone say she was a fake? She's totally the opposite - so natural. Such a great singer and so beautiful, even though she used to be quite a bit heavier than she is now. I love her version of Overjoyed, which you can hear in this interview."
adHRfM5hWGY,2007-08-19 09:18:27+00:00,"those who can't do, criticize... :( She's wonderful."
adHRfM5hWGY,2007-07-26 06:44:23+00:00,why do I see mean comments to such a talented jazz singer??
adHRfM5hWGY,2007-03-26 04:57:51+00:00,thanks for letting me enjoy this video.
adHRfM5hWGY,2007-02-27 07:02:22+00:00,"thanks so much for posting this video. Can't wait for Jane's new album, but sadly i don't think ""our love is here to stay"" is gonna be on it."

0YlW1CT8I8U,2007-12-26 17:26:26+00:00,"This song is original from Tina Turner. Weird, isn't it? :-)"

_YwYeUt6REw,2007-11-12 03:15:39+00:00,Eric Lewis truly has a gift from God.  Mr. Lewis keep encourging Mr. Lennix to stay with his piano lessons.  This song causes me to cry and laugh and gives me hope in every aspect of my life.  I aspire to be a dynamic piano player and Eric Lewis truly uplifts me.  Keep up the good work and continue to be blessing that you really are to others.

xDpGhRTEjL4,2006-07-17 07:25:43+00:00,"this version is better than the one on his cd i dont know who did the beats for his album they need to be fired. anywho. i kinda know lyfe in a tiny way, we im-ed eachother on yahoo like 2 yrs ago, join our lyfe yahoo group, he stops by once in a while."
xDpGhRTEjL4,2006-07-10 07:04:52+00:00,"Wow, I've never heard of this guy before but he's great! Sounds sort of like a mix between Al Green and Otis Redding. Very cool."

I didnt think the sing went fast but i could be mistaken...and I would add another guitar if I could find somebody but it was only me and the girl so we had to improvise by using her voice as the backup rhythm while i did the solo....

hope you liked it anyways :P"
Nxa-SVI94uA,2007-07-31 00:04:12+00:00,"hahaha, thanks....

xA0dteBZM0k,2007-07-25 08:11:40+00:00,I think we can dramatically reduce the corruption in politics if we add more checks and balances. If more power were in the hands of the people.

xA0dteBZM0k,2007-07-24 18:17:22+00:00,we could also stop it by leaving the planet. both are solutions but neither has any clear steps to achievement. How do you stop corruption in politics and a superiority complex in the rich? Bubblegum?

XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-12-01 05:05:02+00:00,Here here!  And those little maggots took credit for it!
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-29 19:35:33+00:00,id like to see the whol cip of this
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-27 06:49:01+00:00,Keating was the best love him hehehehe
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-26 05:23:04+00:00,"YEah, well looks like Costello really was a tip an no iceberg."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-24 02:43:33+00:00,"fabulous work

loved it
loved it
loved it"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-23 20:48:28+00:00,Paul Keatings vision did (and still does) involve a mirror! A simple thing for a simple man with an over active ego!
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-23 20:47:16+00:00,"As far as interest rate hikes, housing debt has increased from 300b in 1991 to 1000b in 2006, interest rates in 1990 was 17% (in 1991 12%), and 2006 6.25%. If you do the sums, and adjust for real wages, they end up being exactly the same: monetary policy is the same as it was when our economy was overheating, and we're at risk of this again now. Since debt is higher, smaller IR changes are needed to have the same impact on demand."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-23 20:46:42+00:00,"The AUD is at its natural 96cUSD because the US has serious issues, which may result in increased interest rates beyond anyone's control. Deficits are standard policy for both parties during slow economic growth."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-20 06:52:02+00:00,"Paul Keating was one of the few politicians who didn't care about polls, and instead followed his vision. His policies changed Australia to a low inflation and steady growth economy. Costello has done nothing but wear the badge while our foreign debt/current account deficit is left to explode. Many with economic backgrounds think that Costello is a waste of space."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-11-10 09:31:22+00:00,another good one Red...Keating was very co-operative...
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-10-28 20:05:13+00:00,"Totally! But we seem to be inundated with them. I'm originally from Melbourne and came to QLD without any preconceptions. :-(  Oh well, Buenos Aires Argentina is looking good right now :-D LOL"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-10-26 22:17:10+00:00,"All the Liberals should be lynched. Unfortunately I live in Queensland where they are so dumb, the say ""I hate Labor"" and can't give you a reason why. We should get rid of Queenslanders and abolish the ability to create coalition governments."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-10-26 22:15:19+00:00,"Unfortunately the masses are morons and have allowed Liberals to sell their workers rights, housing affordability and money down the drain so they can say ""I have an investment property, I'm an owner"" No, your working class like the rest of us only with a massive debt around your neck!"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-18 05:04:07+00:00,this is a great piece by red! thanks yak07 for getting me to look at your reply and thus hearing and watching it all again! :>
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-17 00:16:36+00:00,I'm just writing this to move the yak7 twits comments eventually off the page...
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-14 11:27:21+00:00,"love this guy! The John mcenroe of Australian politics.
Rudd should have him as an adviser then watch little Howard shit himself!!"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-13 16:14:05+00:00,"Agreed, and The Longest Decade suggests the same thing very persuasively."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-10 22:12:32+00:00,"On stalin: estimates range from as low as 4 million to 20 million. Some historians claim 9 million. It depends if you include all the famine deaths... even the largest estimates, from Robert Conquest, have been downwardly revised to 20 million. 

If you are only talking about 'own people', it's confusing. millions of ukrainians were killed by Stalin, and millions of polish/hungarian jews were killed by Hitler. It might be safer to just exclude war casualties."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-10 22:06:01+00:00,"I'm not sure where you get that number of 62 million from. Off top of my head Robert Conquest's estimate is the largest, probably too large, and is around 30 million, tops."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-09-10 21:59:55+00:00,keating has an excellent quote for you: "You boxhead you wouldn't know. You are flat out counting past ten."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-08-15 02:34:05+00:00,do we need any further confirmation that Costello is all tip & no iceberg? hahaha! he can't even lie with a straight face.
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-08-09 10:58:30+00:00,"i keep coming back to this video, tis absolutly awesome, easily reds best work on youtube, bravo"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-31 20:22:50+00:00,I wouldnt worry about them. all tip and no iceberg I reckon... heh heh heh...
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-30 06:07:20+00:00,"electrons hey mate, your probably a geek with no life! LOL give up mate the liberals are a lost force."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-23 14:05:34+00:00,"Bloody top vid great work - go the labour boys, they'll smash little 'war crim' johnnie this year."
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-18 02:04:58+00:00,"John Howard supports extra judicial KILLINGS in the Philippines. Journalists, student activists, civilians with children, farmers, trade union leaders, and congress representatives. With the 10 million dollars of AUSTRALIAN TAX PAYERS MONEY going to the Philippines military. Fact, 800 dead Philippines citizens in the last month responsibilities confirmed by several international bodies. John Howard needs to be ousted, if not replaced, together with Bush and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo"
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-13 04:21:45+00:00,surely there is something in the "different family of leopards but they all have the same spots" quote? c'mon red!

XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-10 05:38:21+00:00,We shouldn't forget Keating. He was a much better PM than Howard.
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-04 12:33:54+00:00,anywhere i can get an unedited version of what he said ?
XQdVJL2CO9o,2007-07-04 02:54:26+00:00,"Paul Keating was the best prime minister we've ever had.

Its just a simple fact. Its just a simple fact!"

No, we didn't only lost until 1429. Bertrand Du Guesclin for instance was a problem for the English. 

The losses were mainly the result of overconfidence by the French nobility and lack of concern about tactics, and of course the longbowmen of England."
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-26 15:48:43+00:00,I remember one time when some french students arrived to our country to see the famous Austerlitz battlefield where Napoleon defeated russians and austrians....omg the counselor of their school thougth Austerlitz lies in Balkan ...jesus we couldn't stop laughing the french need better education (he had university diploma and still didnt even know where their emperor fougth his best battle)
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-25 02:18:12+00:00,Yes it is!
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-19 12:02:14+00:00,What is building/monument - is it Arc de Triomphe?
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-16 14:20:45+00:00,"If we were so unequivocally losing  how comes it lasted so long and that it ended with a French victory ? 
It can be interesting for you to know that the king that lost the most of France, Charles VI, was crazy. 
Anyway, we were winning the hundred years war _after_ she was gone. 
The hundred years war lasted 116 yrs. Joan of Arc was implicated 2 yrs at best."
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-14 12:51:23+00:00,"Damnit, haven't you enough money to buy the glasses you need ?

""I see that you never heard of the hundred years war...
You can add the Saintonge war. BTW, that's the only wars in which the 2 countries were fighting each other alone IIRC."""
iXEpHn1Ky4w,2007-05-13 21:17:07+00:00,"""Britain never lost against France""

That was your sentence. Don't make me waste my time. Your allegation have been replied. 
No need to search for every battle the French lost to the Brits to try to have the last word. 
Just say ""I was wrong"" and let's end it there, TIA."

Just because babies don't realize what they control, or their surroundings doesn't mean that they don't feel. physically or mentally. They have a brain, it's just not mature enough to remember a long time. a baby is a baby, no matter if they are born or still growin!"
oiBcgqNaEi0,2007-07-18 01:41:07+00:00,So what separates them from a fetus? The only thing in my mind is they are no longer inside their mother's body. Other than that until they are about 3 months old they are just bigger air breathing fetuses to me. Just a thought.
oiBcgqNaEi0,2007-07-18 01:40:57+00:00,"well I'm gunna put my 2 cents in... I work in the maturity ward at my local hospital as a volunteer. The Babies in the nusury scratch their faces. Why? Because they don't realize that the fingers connected to their arms on their bodies are under their control. According to the eariler comments I person is a sentient being, but obviously the infant isn't aware of their surroundings, indeed they aren't even aware of what they control and who they are fully."
oiBcgqNaEi0,2007-06-03 14:06:00+00:00,"Wow this is a great video with wonderful music. I'm so touched I'm sitting here crying. I think adoption can be a good option. This way, the mother can be sure the child will be in a family where it feels welcome and protected."
oiBcgqNaEi0,2007-06-02 23:40:15+00:00,"i've gone through the pain of an abortion and i could never ever do it again! i have to live with the emotional pain..but i know god has forgiven me and i have to forgive myself. I will ""NEVER"" have an abortion again.If i never had the abortion, then that baby would be 3 months old today."

What about that? Why dont you make propaganda about pre marital sex instead of abortion? That would be alot smarted. Stop the problem before it happens... People are stupid

nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-06-16 18:33:21+00:00,"afar r closer to somalians and saho than any other tribe in da horn,u dont have to be a genius to work it out,da hadareb and mainly tegre r closer with da beja in sudan (except da habab which many thinks r more mixed with alot more ethnic) u also have da tigrenya who r close to da agame's and amhara."
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-06-16 18:23:26+00:00,dats true brother and dey called semitic ppl.but it happened thosand's of yrs ago and dey became mixed with kushtic ppl that da blood is mixed.
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-23 10:04:00+00:00,I agree you on the whole. I don't know much about genetics but I always thought the Amharic and Tigrinya speakers have genetics from Asia??
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-23 09:57:02+00:00,Each group in the Horn has it's own distict culture that have common features to other ethnic groups around them. Within groups also who share common identity and culture there is sub-cultures. Somalis are not different than the rest of the peope in the horn.
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-22 16:48:26+00:00,This is because there has been intermarriages and migration between this closely  linked languages groups for generations. So when you use the term Cushtic or Semitic it is just linguistic terms not ethnic ones. continued...
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-22 16:37:50+00:00,"Look brothers and sisters, what you fail to see is the term Cushtic and Semitic are relative. What that means is it is just a language groups not an ethnic identification. And that is what most people confuse and don't understand it fully. In fact the Cushtic and Semitic groups of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia have null differences when it comes to DNA analysis. Continued..."
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-22 12:02:12+00:00,"what u talkin about bro.somalians r cushtic and share some tribal linage with some eritreans.i dont know if u r eri or not but afar and saho in eritre would probarly consider themselves closer to somalian in blood linage than rest of eritrea.da nolitic tribes of eri (kunama and nara) r from da nile river from sudan and semtic ppl in eritrea r closer to ethio,sudanese and maybe a touch of arabs.u should know that if u r from da horn."
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-22 01:56:23+00:00,"The people of Somalia, Some Djibutians and the tribes from eastern Ethiopia and Nothern Kenya are all ethnic Somalis. I think Ethiopian and Eritrean are more similar than Somalis"
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-04-12 11:05:34+00:00,sweetsuker no embarrasment my somali brother all i was sayin was that to let ppl know how close somalian r to eritreans.da reason i said i hope u r not right is bcoz i was thinkin if u r right which i thought u might have as a possibility is saho r very close to afar and somali in tradition and language then half of da eritrean brothers here might get embarreseed due to their comment assumption.lol
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-01-29 06:28:24+00:00,so beautful
nS1DsSrd-iA,2007-01-08 14:30:55+00:00,lol i hope u r not right bcoz if u r then they r saho and it took a somalian brother to tell us who they r.this is pretty embarrassin.but im 99% sure they r nara i recognise the woman dance from a 100 miles.

Eritrea should not be here, America, Soviets, Cubans, East Germany, Koreans all aided the World's 3rd poorest country (Ethiopia) to keep Eritrea under Ethiopia's occupation...all we had was sandals and UNITY and we single handedly defeated Ethiopia and put the Cuban/Soviet troops in body bags to liberate Eritrea.

We need more videos of our 8 other tribes in Eritrea."

SsHErd5Sd8U,2007-08-16 19:16:55+00:00,Great job
SsHErd5Sd8U,2007-03-11 11:39:35+00:00,"This is a scene from the film ""Al Oud"" by Fritz Baumann, you can get it on DVD and find a lot of good music in Egypt.
The nubian music was recorded in a small village near Assuan."
SsHErd5Sd8U,2006-11-30 22:59:19+00:00,lot of people just can't realize what they're missing by not travelling. something like that in the evening instead of the usual tv-stupidity...

75xciyVRPTQ,2007-07-19 13:11:57+00:00,Thanks for the information
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-07-16 22:07:21+00:00,"Please,can someone tell me what'Ya Msahani' means? I've got Oum Kolthoum singing this song on C.D & I just love it."
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-04-15 04:09:42+00:00,"No dude, that's almost a direct quote from Wikipedia, I looked it up, you didn't even paraphrase."
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-04-14 22:13:56+00:00,Nice use of wikipedia :P
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-04-13 04:46:50+00:00,"Interesting, I always assumed the Orient referred to those of China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and so on, those of the Middle East/Southwest Asia  were just called Middle Easterners and Arabs.  I'm Lebanese myself."
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-04-02 01:52:54+00:00,"Sorry to ruin the surprise, but the Oud isn't exactly Oriental ... It's Middle Eastern/Arabic"
75xciyVRPTQ,2007-03-10 04:46:54+00:00,how do i get a hold of more music from this group...or are there no official releases? I love Naseer Shamma...and him playing with other musicians is so beautiful.  They are all just as talented.
75xciyVRPTQ,2006-12-24 08:27:07+00:00,Naseer is greatness. He is the Umm Khoultoum of the Oud.
75xciyVRPTQ,2006-11-28 08:17:30+00:00,nothing compares to the joy and difficulty of playing maqaam rast on the guitar....I had the honor of meeting Naseer a coupl of times...the thing about him is that he is not just an Oudest but the way he makes u visualize his music is the key to understanding his pieces...
75xciyVRPTQ,2006-11-09 04:20:04+00:00,he is the best
75xciyVRPTQ,2006-07-12 10:20:23+00:00,btw the Cello player kicks major arse as well. !
75xciyVRPTQ,2006-07-12 10:18:20+00:00,amazing Oudest of our time. 3ala rasi ya bu-nasrah walah. ! thanks for the post. !

1JlaE70be4Y,2007-10-18 15:16:19+00:00,"I don't deny that, but you can't deny his talents. When he released his first album, he originally didn't want to put his name on it, so people wouldn't link him to it, and become popular off Nirvana's success."
1JlaE70be4Y,2007-10-08 06:05:54+00:00,holy shit was that real? the music was perfect and dave's voice was insane for singing live.
1JlaE70be4Y,2007-09-25 22:07:56+00:00,I know you write that to anyon us but I can't help it:every time someone write something like that I hope they know that Nirvana was BLEACH until Dave joined...then you have NEVERMIND...and IN UTERO...so I guess you BLEACH fan? :D:D:D. X.
1JlaE70be4Y,2007-09-17 20:15:59+00:00,"omg, what an awesome performance.. Grohls voice sounds so damn great!"

YI4qSdhmq6U,2007-05-18T21:19:46Z,"Ian paisley sitting next to former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, collusion between sectarian killers and the brits coming to light daily, the UVF announced it's putting it's weapons ""out of reach"".  I'd say stability has arrived and the nationalists are cleaning up.  our time is near.  Ireland will be united peacefully, through the ballot not the bomb, as it should be."
YI4qSdhmq7U,2007-05-18T21:19:47Z,Monte1Carlo is clarely wrong.. and watch out m8.. IRA is coming for you!
