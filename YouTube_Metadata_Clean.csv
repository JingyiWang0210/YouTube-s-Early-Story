In the waning light of a winter's afternoon, Jesse Taylor turns away from his drawing table and grabs a caramel-colored acoustic guitar ¡ª a trusty Fender ¡ª that he keeps next to his desk. Taylor doesn't play much in public anymore, and he can't find a guitar pick among all these boxes of colored pencils.

Yet Jesse plays with confidence as he breaks into a loose, happy version of ""Don't Give Up"" ¡ª a rousing get-off-your-seat instrumental that opens his last studio album (""South Side Guitar,"" in collaboration with John X. Reed). Jesse penned the song himself, about the time he learned he was sick.

""Whenever anybody says to me, 'You're dying' or 'You're going to die,' I think to myself, 'Well, you're dying too. We're all dying. We start dying from the day we're born,"" says Taylor. ""As far as my own thoughts on mortality, well, it's a bummer. Because I've got so much I want to do. So much I need to do. And I get afraid, sometimes, that some of it is going to get cut short.""",5652,19,,1,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbhbAamG4,https://archive.org/details/youtube-gUkbhbAamG4

(To clear things up, Tyler_yj is NOT me)

In my opinion this video is one of the best music videos ever made, including real-life videos made by the actual bands. Here's the comment the creator made when he posted it.



It's very difficult to comment on this video. The idea isn't really original, it's the same theme of the song, same theme of the original music video. 

It's a video about life in general, a confession about life, full of passion, rage, deception, determination, desire to fight, desire to give up. A complete theme, without judgment, just a backward step on the life, nothing else. 
Some people said me this video is really pessimistic, others said the message is very hopeful. I'm glad this video bring this ambiguity. 
Like in the real music video, I have put neutral scenes and elements, without explanation or reason... I love it. I have inset also real scenes of the Foo Fighters' singer to keep the side of a real music video. 

Hmm I can't successfully talk about this video, it's a feeling I can't explain correctly, watch it, explanations aren't necessary for this one ; I hope you enjoy it.

-2MSmX6d4dc,Green Day - 86 @ Letterman,danicat91,"['green','day','86']",2006-08-09T00:00:00Z,,"86 Live at Letterman.

People, please stop saying that you like the 'old' Green Day better, that the new songs have no real message or whatever.. Green Day just freaking rock. Period.
Look at the difference between 1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and Dookie, or Nimrod and Warning! I never hear people complaint about that, while the difference is distinct..

Edit: a lot of people think this performance was in 1986. It's not, 86 is the name of the song. In 1986 they didn't even release their first EP yet. Their first show was in 1988.

Like it says on GreenDayAuthority.com; ""86 is about the underground scene and being kicked out of it, because when you leave, you can never go back. This particular song is about Billie being the one getting kicked out. Everyone from the local punk scene threatened them after they got back from touring Dookie. Kids would spit, insult, threaten to beat up, and one girl wrote on a wall at Gillman 'Billie Joe Must Die'. Billie begins to question himself.""

Lyrics:

Baby, you've been going so crazy 
Lately, nothing seems to be going right 
Solo, why do you have to get so low 
You're so
You've been waiting in the sun too long

But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Colder, crying on your shoulder 
Hold her, and tell her everythings gonna be fine 
Surely, you've been going to early 
Hurry, 'cause no one's gonna be stopped

No, now, now, now, now if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Baby, there's something going on today 
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing 
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

So, now, now, now, now, now if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing 
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
Ah baby sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
For the love you bring won't mean a thing 
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

Lyrics:

Everything is open
Nothing is set in stone
Rivers turn to ocean
Oceans tide you home
Home is where your heart is
But your heart had to roam
Drifting over bridges
Never to return
Watching bridges burn

You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you

Nobody is an island
Everyone has to go
Pillars turn to butter
Butterflying low
Low is where your heart is
But your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges
Never with the flow

And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time

Everywhere there's trouble
Nowhere's safe to go
Pushes turn to shovel's
Shoveling the snow
Frozen you have chosen
The path you wish to go
Drifting now forever
And forever more
Until you reach your shore

You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces
Just driftwood hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you
And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line

So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long time
You've been drifting for a long long
Drifting for a long long time

Leave them all behind 
To find you 
For you alone 
I'd leave ninety-nine 
Leave them all behind 
To find you 

It's dark and lonely 
And the path is unclear 
Can't move my feet 
Because I'm frozen in fear 
Then you say, ""My child, my child 
I am always here, I'm by your side"" 

(chorus) 

You're never too far down 
I promise you'll be found 
I'll reach into the mud and mirely clay 
Pursue you to the end 
Like a faithful friend 
Nothing in this world can keep me away

""...at half-past nine this morning we were actually running an exercise for, er, over, a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning, so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright!""

On the afternoon of 7th July 2005, information came to light about a private company running a terror rehearsal operation, featuring 'mock broadcasts', in London at the same time that real explosions were reported to have occurred on the transport network.



These revelations came not from an anonymous source but instead from the Managing Director of the private firm running the terror rehearsal operation. The private firm is Visor Consultants and the Managing Director in question is ex-Metropolitan Police man, Peter Power. The client for whom the terror rehearsal was being organised is, thus far, unknown.

listen carefully at the radio interview about yet another coincidence, like on 9-11, the supposedly terrorist plot in London on 7-7, had anti terrorists drills at 2 stations only. And what happens? those 2 Tube Stations in question were hit. Coincidence?
The four suicide suspects had bought return tickets instead of single tickets. And after investigations, the media said their profile didn't fit the profiles of suicide bombers.
The fact that the alleged bombers purchased return tickets.
None of the alleged terrorists are known to have said ""Allahu Akbar"" before their deaths.
The alleged terrorists carried the explosives in their bags instead of wearing them. 
Suicide was tactically unnecessary -- they could have merely left the bags on the cars (assuming they knew what was in them). 
The bombers, two recent fathers, one with a wife pregnant with his second child, a university graduate and a teacher of disabled children don't fit the usual ""suicide"" bomber profile.

le mythe officiel du 11/9 (19 pirates de l'air arabes, al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, un ordinateur portable dans une grotte afghane) et montre comment ce mythe a ¨¦t¨¦ fabriqu¨¦ dans les 10 jours qui ont suivi le 11 Septembre par des fuites organis¨¦es par George Tenet et Richard Clarke aupr¨¨s des m¨¦dias, par des remarques faites par Colin Powell, ainsi que par le discours prononc¨¦ par Bush au Congr¨¨s le 20 septembre. Depuis lors, chacun d'eux a ¨¦t¨¦ pris en flagrant d¨¦lit de mensonge sur l'Irak et sur d'autres sujets, si bien qu'il est grand temps de mettre ¨¤ nu leurs mensonges sur le 11/9.

Apr¨¨s avoir pass¨¦ en revue les faits ¨¦tablis, afin de d¨¦montrer que la v¨¦racit¨¦ du compte-rendu officiel du 11/9 n'a jamais ¨¦t¨¦ prouv¨¦e, l'auteur ¨¦labore une th¨¦orie du terrorisme international fond¨¦e sur les exp¨¦riences faites avec l'assassinat de Kennedy, les Brigades rouges, le groupe Baader-Meinhof et d'autres affaires plus r¨¦centes. 

Il affirme que le terrorisme international, y compris le 11/9, est en grande partie le produit des services de renseignement, et met en lumi¨¨re le r?le des lampistes et des boucs ¨¦missaires, des r¨¦seaux de ""taupes"" ¨¤ l'int¨¦rieur du gouvernement et des m¨¦dias, des professionnels anonymes qui sont les v¨¦ritables auteurs des atrocit¨¦s, et des cellules de commandement secr¨¨tes existant dans des contextes paramilitaires privatis¨¦s.

le mythe officiel du 11/9 (19 pirates de l'air arabes, al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, un ordinateur portable dans une grotte afghane) et montre comment ce mythe a ¨¦t¨¦ fabriqu¨¦ dans les 10 jours qui ont suivi le 11 Septembre par des fuites organis¨¦es par George Tenet et Richard Clarke aupr¨¨s des m¨¦dias, par des remarques faites par Colin Powell, ainsi que par le discours prononc¨¦ par Bush au Congr¨¨s le 20 septembre. Depuis lors, chacun d'eux a ¨¦t¨¦ pris en flagrant d¨¦lit de mensonge sur l'Irak et sur d'autres sujets, si bien qu'il est grand temps de mettre ¨¤ nu leurs mensonges sur le 11/9.

Apr¨¨s avoir pass¨¦ en revue les faits ¨¦tablis, afin de d¨¦montrer que la v¨¦racit¨¦ du compte-rendu officiel du 11/9 n'a jamais ¨¦t¨¦ prouv¨¦e, l'auteur ¨¦labore une th¨¦orie du terrorisme international fond¨¦e sur les exp¨¦riences faites avec l'assassinat de Kennedy, les Brigades rouges, le groupe Baader-Meinhof et d'autres affaires plus r¨¦centes. 

Il affirme que le terrorisme international, y compris le 11/9, est en grande partie le produit des services de renseignement, et met en lumi¨¨re le r?le des lampistes et des boucs ¨¦missaires, des r¨¦seaux de ""taupes"" ¨¤ l'int¨¦rieur du gouvernement et des m¨¦dias, des professionnels anonymes qui sont les v¨¦ritables auteurs des atrocit¨¦s, et des cellules de commandement secr¨¨tes existant dans des contextes paramilitaires privatis¨¦s.

The Video was made two months after the invasion of Iraq, in May 2003. It compares Hitler's treatment of the Jews with Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.

Lyrics:
Mr. Spielberg, have I got a movie for you. It's called DEAR PALESTINE and it's about how we never see things from their side. We can show them forced from their homes by the knife and why no one cared when word came of their plight. But we can show the world they too are human beings. It seems to me you know the theme. 

Cause you know you know how it feels. You know you know how it feels. They're chosen too. They're chosen too. But what can we do when a little Hitler is in me, a little Hitler is in you, and a little Hitler is in them too.

Reincarnation, I don't believe in but if I did, I know six million you can bet your ass came back as Palestinians imprisoned. SCHINDLER'S LIST opinion into submission while Palestine does the time for Hitler's horror. No more can we let Cain slay his brother and make the hate for which we all must suffer. 

Mister Spielberg, won't you work on this little dream? Let me tell you my favorite scene of a German Jewish family admiring art recovered from Nazis hanging on a wall in a home near Tel Aviv, a home once owned by Palestinian refugees. 

You know you know how it feels. You know you know how it feels. We're chosen too! We're chosen too! But what can we do when the inner Hitler that's in you presumes exception to virtue and justice only for the Jews?",1810,29,,15,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJEpcNfgbg,https://archive.org/details/youtube-yHJEpcNfgbg

===========================================

The topic of disinformation is a very complicated one. Essays, lengthy papers and whole treatises have been written on the subject. But the very length of most discussions overwhelms people, so that they never get an accurate picture of what disinformation looks like.

So I thought I'd take a crack at a very simple definition of disinformation, something that is short enough to read in two minutes.

Disinformation is:

* Repeating the same false claims over and over even when people have proven that such claims are contrary to the evidence 

* Spending more energy causing in-fighting and disruptions then helping to promote the truth, and causing dedicated activists to waste time rebutting obviously false claims and theories

* Unnecessarily alienating large sections of the population by attacking victims' families, certain religious or ethnic groups, or political parties with no reason

* Calling someone names instead of addressing that person's theories or claimed facts",7243,14,,2,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX9QMFMfjow,https://archive.org/details/youtube-pX9QMFMfjow

from http://www.myspace.com/velvetbrickrocks
Velvet Brick used to be something - now it's something else. We really don't know what we're onto - but we like where it is going. We are always progressing and changing. Kind of like molting. Deanna sings and the boys play. It sounds simple, and it kind of is. Velvet Brick IS a little hard, a little agressive, but with a certian edge that's just as far from cocky as it is from flashy. The band's tightwire act can be seen in any place where booze and nightlife collide.

from ""Dan"" :
I heard of this Texas group from Noel Gallagher who mentioned them in some interview. So out of curiousity i checked them out. When I finally heard them I understood why Noel liked them, Cotton Mather is even more Beatle-ish than Oasis (if you consider Oasis beatle-ish). Now for there music. The lead singer does a near perfect John Lennon impression on alot of the songs. To witness this listen to there other album Kon Tiki on the song ""Home Cameo"" you can barely tell the difference, and i've been listening to Lennon for years, so I kid you not.

======= Attero Dominatus LYRICS =======

Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The reich has fallen

We stand at the gates of Berlin
With two and a half million men
With six thousand tanks in our ranks
Use them as battering rams

Artillery leading our way
A million grenades has been launched
The nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken

Marshall Zhukov¡¯s orders:
Serve me Berlin on a plate!
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take

The price of a war must be payed
Millions of lives has been lost
The price must be paid by the men
That started the war in the 30¡¯s

The spring of the year 45¡ä
The year when the nazis will fall
We¡¯re inside the gates of Berlin
The beak of the eagle is broken

Comrade Stalins orders:
Serve me it¡¯s head on a plate
Disregard the losses
The eagle¡¯s land is ours to take

March!
Fight!
Die!
In Berlin!
March!
Fight!
Conquer!
Berlin!

----------------------------------
I'm talking, mom, I know the situation is personal
But it's something that has to be told
As I was making this beat
You was all I could think about
You heard my voice

Just think, just think...
What if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Just, just wait, just pause for a second
Let me plead my case

It's the late seventies, you seventeen
And having me, that will ruin everything
It's a lot of angels waiting on their wings
You see me in your sleep, so you can't kill your dreams

Three hundred dollars, that's the price of living?
Mommy, I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go though with the knife decision

But it's hard to make the right move when you in high school
Now you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping on the bus and the rain is pouring
What you want, morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?
Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

I'm a child of the King, ain't no need to go fear me
And I see the flowing tears, so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scary
'Cuz who knows what my future holds?

The truth be told you ain't told a soul
You ain't even showing, I'm just two months old
Through your clothes try to hide me, deny me
Went up three sizes

Your pride got you lying, saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in WIC food lines
Your friends look at you funny, but look at you mommy
That's a life inside, take a look at your tummy

What is becoming, Ma? I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he's a star from the ultrasound
Our spirits connected, doors open now,
Nothing but love and respect, thanks for holding it down
She let me live

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul, know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live?
Can I live?

It's uplifing for real, y'all
I ain't passing no judgement
Ain't making no decisions
I'm just telling y'all my story

I love life, I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
And a strong woman who had to make a sacrifice

Thanks for listening...
Thanks for listening...
Momma, thanks for listening",,,,,Hide,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcW738wXoHk,https://archive.org/details/youtube-QcW738wXoHk

I love Beck and his music, this is not an anti-Beck video but an anti Scientology video. 
Since I've made this video, I've been told that Beck Hansen was born into the religion having both parents as scientologist, please remember that he didn't really have a choice. And this video is not really attacking the scientologist individual but the whole has a fraudulent fake religion. Hubbard did make a bet with a friend of his that he would/could create a new religion (which turned out to be a new pollution)

My original description of the video now follows.....

This another cheap homemade video collage of the excellent Beck Hansen using the unreliable Windows movie maker (I have a love/hate relationship with that program)
I do question why a clever man like Beck Hansen is still with the fraudulent Church of Scientology. Even Ron Hubbard's own son spoke out against that ridiculous religion which is based on lies. Also, please note (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/E-Meter/). Although L.Ron Hubbard's name is on the patent application of the E-meter, it was actually invented by a chiropractor named Volney Mathison, and was originally called the Mathison Model B Electropsychometer which was promoted as an aid to psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, and psychotherapy is ironically loathed and detested by the Church of Scientology. But of course they don't tell you this when they want to recruit you and demand for your money. I may be a cynic but i am also a philanthropist. Please do pass on this information for it could save lives and money of troubled vulnerable people. Many of us have downers at some points in our lives.

Hubbard was originally a pulp science fiction and adventure writer, Dianetics was first publicised through John W. Campbell's magazine Astounding Science Fiction, many of his early followers were recruited from the science fiction milieu and Scientology magazines even now are often illustrated with pictures of spaceships and exploding stars. Hubbard said that the modern-day science fiction genre of space opera is merely an unconscious recollection of events, such as Xenu's mass murder, that really happened millions of years ago.

From God's Arms to My Arms to Yours

So many wrong decisions in my past, 
I'm not quite sure if I could ever hope to trust my judgment anymore. 
But lately I've been thinking, because it's all I've had to do. 
And in my heart I feel that I should give this child to you.

And maybe you can tell your baby when you love him so
that he's been loved before
by someone who delivered your son
from God's arms to my arms to yours.

And if you choose to tell him and if he wants to know 
how the one who gave him life could bear to let him go, 
just tell him there was sleepless nights I prayed and paced the floor 
and knew the only peace I'd find is if this child was yours.

I know that you don't have to do this, but could you kiss him once for me 
the first time that he ties his shoe or falls or skins his knees?
and could you hold him twice as long when he makes his first mistake 
and try to tell him that he's not alone? Sometimes that's all it takes. 
And he's not alone. I know how much he'll ache.
This may not be the answer for another girl like me 
and I'm not on a soap box singing how we all should be. 
I'm just trusting in my feelings and I'm trusting God above,
and I'm trusting that you can give this baby both his mother's love.",28288,70,,39,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiBcgqNaEi0,https://archive.org/details/youtube-oiBcgqNaEi0

from tikitom9:
Thank you for your interest in this work. It brings back good memories. Tom Curtis (That's me) and Monte Thompson did all the artwork on this at the San Francisco Production Group in San Francisco. The Residents brought us the soundtrack and we storyboarded the piece based on that. We scanned the film and painted choice frames using a mainframe graphics system called ""Images"" built by Computer Graphics Lab. This was the same system used to create the well known ATT globe icon. The fire effects were done using a program called cycling and several scripts were written from scratch to add some of the effects. We edited it with editor Don Ahrens using a pre 3D graphics system called ADO to move the saucers. The piece was used in The Residents multimedia game ""Freak Show"" and I believe it is shown in a theater in one of the tents. It looks pretty cheesy today but at the time it was pretty advanced.",12140,35,,6,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2qSh46hilk,https://archive.org/details/youtube-k2qSh46hilk

few articles on other subjects
-------------------
Adolf Hitler was obsessed with the occult, in his case the Thule Society, closely inter-connected with German Theosophists. The jolly roger, skull and cross bones, ""der Totenkopf"" was an emblem worn by Hitler's SS soldiers and was emblazoned on SS armoured cars and tanks (see images on this page). The SS was a religious cult of sworn Hitler/German ancestor worship. 
If the Nazis' occult lodges had been exposed then shut down, not treated as a taboo, millions of lives could have been saved. A small price to pay for insane racism and the blood of millions of people. The second world war need never have happened. Unless you want the occult fuelling a totalitarian West's Third World War 'on terror' and their 'New World Order' - please - do your bit to expose George W. Bush, the bonesmen and other interconnected lodges round the world.
----------------------
Why are these particular relatives of 9/11 victims not receiving any public attention? Has everyone forgotten them?
Which members of the government are lying, and why? Why do the 911 relatives also want answers? 

Why don't the media tell of the many witnesses who saw and heard more than two explosions in the WTC?
How did they come up with the names of the ""culprits"" so quickly after just 2 days (please note that 7 of the 19 are alive)?
Why have the FBI not release the Flight Data Recorder info? and where are the flight recorders?
Why did George H.W. Bush meet bin Laden's brother on 9/11?
Why did the FBI ignore Bin Laden's family, who left the United States without further investigation days after the attack?
How did Bush see the first plane crash on live camera?
Why did none of the 19 hijackers appear on the passenger lists?
Why the attack on Cynthia McKinney for asking: 1) why has there been no investigation of the 9-11 attack? and 2) did Bush/CIA/NSA know of it beforehand, and allow it to happen?
Why did Mayor Guilani sell WTC rubble to India for recycling and also China? Who made that decision?
And why in a candid moment in front of U.S. troops, Donald Rumsfeld strayed from the official story of heroic passengers flying fight 93 into the ground by saying it was ""shot down."" This is found on YouTube.

I do question why a clever man like Beck Hansen is still with the fraudulent Church of Scientology. Even Ron Hubbard's own son spoke out against that ridiculous religion which is based on lies. Also, please note (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/E-Me ter/). Although L.Ron Hubbard's name is on the patent application of the E-meter, it was actually invented by a chiropractor named Volney Mathison, and was originally called the Mathison Model B Electropsychometer which was promoted as an aid to psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, and psychotherapy is ironically loathed and detested by the Church of Scientology. But of course they don't tell you this when they want to recruit you and demand for your money. I may be a cynic but i am also a philanthropist. Please do pass on this information for it could save lives and money of troubled vulnerable people. Many of us have downers at some points in our lives.

Senator Bob Graham is interviewed. He had quite a lot to say in just a few sentences. ""I can just state that within 9/11 there are too many secrets, that is information that has not been made available to the public for which there are specific, tangible, credible answers and that withholding of those secrets has eroded public confidence in their government as it relates to their own security...embarrassment, apology, regret, those are not characteristics associated with the current White House...if, by conspiracy, you mean more than one person involved, yes, there was more than one person, and there was some collaboration of efforts among agencies and the administration to keep information out of the public's hands.

The Brave 13 Apprentice Boys shut the gates of the city against the forces of James II in 1688 commencing the Siege of Derry.

The Siege of Londonderry in the years 1688-1689 played a very important role in securing the victory of the Williamite forces in Britain, and indeed parts of Europe. The success of King William III and the Glorious Revolution effectively stopped the building of a tyrannical empire by Louis XIV of France and his ally, the deposed King of England, James II. The theory of the Divine right of Kings was replaced by reforms put in place by King William III and Queen Mary, establishing the supremacy of parliamentary democracy and basic freedoms of the rule of law that we enjoy today.

Lyrics:
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun)It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within(I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(It's like)It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Lyrics:
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

source: http://www.abandonware-videos.org

Sound Fantasy is an unreleased video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and its Japanese counterpart, the Super Famicom. Interactive media artist Toshio Iwai designed the game in the early 1990s using concepts from the installation art piece Music Insects, which he created during his time as an Artist in Residence at the San Francisco Exploratorium.[1] However, the finished product was never brought to market by Nintendo for unknown reasons.

Its eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics may have been the main factor in its cancellation; music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.

Sound Fantasy was to come packed-in with the SNES Mouse and mouse pad, and it would arrive in a larger game box to hold its contents similar to Super Nintendo games like Mario Paint and EarthBound. It is speculated that Nintendo chose to use Mario Paint to launch its mouse peripheral in 1992 instead, as that game was endorsed by Mario, one of gaming's most recognizable mascots.

Toshio Iwai eventually went on to convert his work into the PC game SimTunes in 1996, and many of Sound Fantasy's unreleased gameplay elements can be found there.

In April 2005, to celebrate the Japanese launch of Toshio Iwai's latest work, Electroplankton for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo opened an exhibit at Tokyo's Harajuku Station to focus on the new game and on Iwai himself. Nintendo made available for perusal the box art and manual for Sound Fantasy, but the ""lost game"" was not made playable there. Those who appreciate Iwai's work, however, hope that someday the completed game will be made available for download via Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console service. - [wikipedia]",13118,38,,5,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypU5m-AeGvU,https://archive.org/details/youtube-ypU5m-AeGvU

Lyrics:
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)

Stoked like a fire and ready to take a savage bite out of calendar year 2007, hard rock bruisers Broken Teeth are planning a vicious touring attack while finalizing another venomous record of snakebite rock-n-roll.

As the band  wins ""Best Metal Band""of 2005 in the Austin Chronicle Awards during SXSW Music Conference, they hit an increasingly prolific stride, Broken Teeth's live set has been injected with new songs that lean into an upper pace reaching for more Judas Priest/Motorhead style power with tracks slated for the new release coming in 07 (tentatively titled ""ELECTRIC"")  such as ""Bonfire"",""Blood on the Radio,"" ""Bullets & Booze,"" ""Roll Over"" and ""Electric."" As David Beeson and fellow guitarist Jared Tuten tackle the crackle of the hard-bitten Teeth -- fronted by screamer Jason McMaster and backed by bassist Brett McCormick and banging Bruce Rivers on drums -- continue to unleash brass-knuckle knockouts on your scene, and beyond.

By design, destination beyond is rushing forward at a dizzying, but welcome pace. The new year will find a hungry Broken Teeth chewing up the road throughout the Midwest, Both Coasts, South by Southwest and any other outlet bold enough to welcome the high-voltage power surge. Along the way, the band will continue to write, record and otherwise conspire to spit out a new album by early 2007.

Open wide and consider yourself warned. Broken Teeth has a hard-earned chip on its shoulder and in the coming years, it's here to stay.

LYRICS:
Seven O'clock in the evening
Watchin somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me
She says ""Is this 'Behind the Music'
With Lynard Skynard?""
And I say ""I don't know.
Say, it's gettin' late...what you wanna do for dinner?
She says ""I kinda had a big lunch.
So I'm not super hungry.""
I said ""Well you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either
But I could eat.""
She said ""So what do you have in mind?""
I said ""I don't know what about you?""
She said ""I don't care, if you're hungry, let's eat.""
I said ""That's what we're gonna do!""
""But first you gotta tell me
What it is you're hungry for!""
And she says ""Let me think...
...What's left in our refrigerator?""
I said ""Well, there's tuna, I know.""
She said ""That went bad a week ago!""
I said ""Is the chili OK?""
She said ""You finished that yesterday!""
I hopped up and I said
""I don't know, do you want to get something delivered?""
She's like ""Why would I want to eat liver?
I don't even like liver!""
I'm like ""No, I said 'delivered'.""
She's like ""I heard you say liver!""
I'm like ""I should know what I said...""
She's like ""Whatever, I just don't want any liver!""
Well I was gonna say something
But my cell phone started to ring
Now who could be callin' me?
Well I checked my caller ID
It was just cousin Larry
Callin' for the third time today...
My wife said ""Let it go to voicemail.""
I said, ""OK.""
""Where were we? Oh, Dinner, Right
So what d'ya want to do?""
She said ""Why don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?""
""Yeah,"" I said, ""Why don't you?""
And then she said ""Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?""
I says ""No""
She says ""Yes""
I says ""No""
She says ""Yes""
I says ""No""
She says ""Yes...
...Oh, here's your keys""
I step a little bit closer
Say ""OK, where ya want to go?""
She says ""How about The Ivy?""
I said ""Yeah, well I don't know...""
I don't feel like gettin all dressed up
And eatin' expensive food
She's says ""Olive Garden?""
I say ""Nah, I'm not in the mood...
...And Burrito King would make me gassy
There's no doubt""
She says ""Just forget about it""
I said ""No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!""
Then I get an idea
I says ""I know what we'll do!""
She says ""What?""
I say ""Guess""
She says ""What?""
I say ""We're goin' to the drive-thru!""
So we head out the front door
Open the garage door
Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors
Put my key in the ignition
And then I turn it sideways
Then we fasten our seat belts
As we pull out the driveway
Then we drive to the drive-thru
Heading off to the drive-thru
We're approaching the drive-thru
Getting close to the drive-thru!
Almost there at the drive-thru
Now we're here at the drive thru
Here in line at the drive-thru
Did I mention the drive-thru?

""Chocolate Rain""

Chocolate Rain
Some stay dry and others feel the pain
Chocolate Rain
A baby born will die before the sin

Chocolate Rain
The school books say it can't be here again
Chocolate Rain
The prisons make you wonder where it went

Chocolate Rain
Build a tent and say the world is dry
Chocolate Rain
Zoom the camera out and see the lie 

Chocolate Rain
Forecast to be falling yesterday
Chocolate Rain
Only in the past is what they say

Chocolate Rain
Raised your neighborhood insurance rates
Chocolate Rain
Makes us happy 'livin in a gate

Chocolate Rain
Made me cross the street the other day
Chocolate Rain
Made you turn your head the other way

(Chorus)
Chocolate Rain
History quickly crashing through your veins
Chocolate Rain
Using you to fall back down again
[Repeat]

Chocolate Rain
Seldom mentioned on the radio
Chocolate Rain
Its the fear your leaders call control

Chocolate Rain
Worse than swearing worse than calling names
Chocolate Rain
Say it publicly and you're insane

Chocolate Rain
No one wants to hear about it now
Chocolate Rain
Wish real hard it goes away somehow

Chocolate Rain
Makes the best of friends begin to fight
Chocolate Rain
But did they know each other in the light? 

Chocolate Rain
Every February washed away
Chocolate Rain
Stays behind as colors celebrate

Chocolate Rain
The same crime has a higher price to pay
chocolate Rain
The judge and jury swear it's not the face

(Chorus)

Chocolate Rain
Dirty secrets of economy
Chocolate Rain
Turns that body into GDP 

Chocolate Rain
The bell curve blames the baby's DNA
Chocolate Rain
But test scores are how much the parents make

Chocolate Rain
'Flippin cars in France the other night
Chocolate Rain
Cleans the sewers out beneath Mumbai

Chocolate Rain
'Cross the world and back its all the same
Chocolate Rain
Angels cry and shake their heads in shame

Chocolate Rain
Lifts the ark of paradise in sin
Chocolate Rain
Which part do you think you're 'livin in?

Chocolate Rain
More than 'marchin more than passing law
Chocolate Rain
Remake how we got to where we are.

His trademark is a unique dirtch of dark and murky blues boogie and sex-swamp. He is the epitome of an old school one man show with his custom made boot stomp box, electric semi-hollow guitar and a voice that is at once angelic and evil. 

After seeing Macdonald solo, it is easy to see how other instruments might just get in the way of the boogie spook and feelings he nails. There is a scent of the sweet and dangerous, of the sexy and vulnerable.

(excerpt from the liner notes)

""The Red Room is a corner bar in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, a couple blocks from Katherine's mom's, where we live in the U.S. 

Harley Junior (a.k.a. ""H"" or ""Nick"") was kind enough to open it on a Sunday and give us the run of the place, so we moved aside the pool table, set up a P.A. and invited a few friends to drop by later that night. 

Everything on this disk was played and recorded that day, February 1st, 2004, between 6pm and 2am closing time - just me, my guitar, my foot and harmonica, live with no overdubs. 

Surviving my cruel process of elimination, a lucky thirteen (eight new originals, three new versions, and a couple covers) made it to this disc. The production cost was about $200, including 3 rooms at the Holiday Motel and a $50 bar tab. 

I thank everyone who so generously contributed their time and equipment, especially Chris Aaron, H, the Red Room staff, recording engineers Dave Kent and Don Jackovich, mastering engineers Plopper and Vicarious Bliss. Thanks also to Connie for the use of her house, her daughter and so much more, Katherine for more than i can even express, Peter for his analog delay, Jessica, both Jeffs, Zack, Richard, Jim, Tim, Dylan, Hillel, Moolay Management and all who cheered me on and helped load out at 3am.""

Paroles par/Lyrics by Alexe? Fatianov 

Rossignols, ? Rossignols, 
Ne d¨¦rangez point les soldats, 
Laissez-les s'assoupir un instant, 
S'assoupir un instant. 

Le printemps est revenu au front, 
Et les soldats n'arrivent pas ¨¤ dormir, 
Non pas ¨¤ cause des salves de canon, 
Mais en raison des rossignols qui ont perdu la t¨ºte! 
Ils ont oubli¨¦ que la bataille fait rage, 
Et chantent comme ¨¤ chaque retour du printemps. 

(Refrain) 

Mais que signifie la guerre, pour un rossignol ? 
Un rossignol a sa vie ¨¤ lui. 
Un des soldats ne dort pas; il pense ¨¤ sa maison, 
Aux vertes prairies qui s'¨¦tendent par-del¨¤ l'¨¦tang, 
O¨´ les rossignols chantent toute la nuit, 
Et o¨´ quelqu'un l'attend. 

(Refrain) 

Cependant, le combat reprendra demain. 
C'est le destin, c'est notre devoir d'y aller, 
Sans avoir re?u assez damour 
Loin de nos bien-aim¨¦es ¨¦pouses, 
Loin de nos champs de ma?s. 
Mais chaque pas en avant 
Nous rapproche davantage de notre patrie.


Nightingales, nightingales, do not disturb the soldiers,
Let them sleep for a while,
Sleep for a while...

The spring has come to the frontlines.
And soldiers cannot get asleep. 
Not due to cannon salvos' din,
But due to nightingales who lost their minds! 
They have forgotten that battles go on
And sing as usual in every spring.

Nightingales, nightingales, do not disturb the soldiers,
Let them sleep for a while,
Sleep for a while...

But what a war means for that bird!
A nightingale has a life of his own.
A soldier doesnt sleep, of his house thinking
And his green garden beyond the pond,
Where nightingales whole nights are singing,
And someone waits that soldier to come back home.

Nightingales, nightingales, do not disturb the soldiers,
Let them sleep for a while,
Sleep for a while...

Tomorrow comes another fight -
It is our fate that we had to go
Without having had enough of love,
Away from our cornfields and beloved wives;
But every step forward in that combat
Brings us closer back to our motherland.

Nightingales, nightingales, do not disturb the soldiers,
Let them sleep for a while,
Sleep for a while...

The band LOKEY formed in 1999 with vocalist Terry Anderson & guitarist Brad Jones, after dissolving their former project Judge Mental.

After years of working with various second guitarists and drummers, LOKEY finally found a perfect rhythm section with ex-Blood Engine members Jon Frugia (Drums) in 2001 and later, Jimmy Bell (Bass) in 2005. Deciding to carry on as a 4-piece, LOKEY has since evolved into one of the hardest working & respected acts in Texas. After setting aside past material from their first three CDs ""Seven weeks in a day"" 1999, ""From the Inside"" 2001, & ""A Black Thing E.P."" 2003. They continue on with 2004's wildly successful ""Beautality"" & now are focused on a more original, streamlined, full throttle sound and recording their 2007 full length CD ""Reconstruction"". A revamped, re-energized LOKEY has begun focusing on distribution and regional touring to support the new album due out later this year.",3172,15,,2,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiY06N95BTw,https://archive.org/details/youtube-eiY06N95BTw

Lyrics:

Your tough, you give me with your hand
When you caress my skin, I'm under your command
Girl, you hypnotize me with your eyes
It took me some time, but now I realize
It's you to whom which I belong
I love it, the feeling's getting strong

Chorus:
I like
The things you do to me
I like
It brings up ecstasy
I like
It really turns me on
I like
The feelings getting strong

Verse 2:
Oh girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave, I'm on my hands and knees
Words can't express the way I feel
Emotions for you- are so real
Girl, you love me over and over again
Don't stop, please don't let it end

Chorus

You know I love it
Hey girl, you know I care
Suga, you know I love it, baby

Rights belong to Toby Mac

lyrics:

No one believed her
No one imagined it was true
No one could see her winter haven coming into view
She says she's seen the land beyond
She said she's walked her Babylon
She felt the cold beneath her feet
And time stood still where the winter won't sleep (where the winter won't sleep)

Chorus
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia

All hope was fading...(all hope was fading)...a darkness far beyond their might
But love came crusading on the wings of healing sacrifice
He gave them something to believe
Came back in all His majesty
He conquered evil through His love and handed them the land they were dreaming of (love came crusading)

Chorus
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia

I never dreamed it but it seems that He's alive again
Shaking His mane He's just the same as I remembered Him
The spell is weakening with every breath He's breathing in
And when He roars...she can't ignore that He's our king again

(...There, just beyond the lamppost...)

I've seen, I've seen, I've seen a new world...
Into a new world...Into Narnia

Chrous
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia
I've seen a new world...like nothing before...just step through the door right
Into a new world...Into Narnia

Into a new world...Narnia",1166531,2890,,566,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ftfhv-FWag,https://archive.org/details/youtube-1Ftfhv-FWag

In a darker millennium that has approached, two lyricist rose from L.A. area and the abode of shadows to form what is Life-Convicts. Dedicated to quality conscious hip-hop composed of hard-hitting lyrics.

Music as expressed through Hip-Hop is now dominating the world, like it or not! Hip Hop is one genre, which formed out of the rich African musical traditions of West Africa brought over during the African-Holocaust. Traditionally this music has been either religious in nature, about love or about social reform.

Unfortunately, today, Hip-Hop is more a dangerous weapon used by major corporations against the youth to keep them failing and trapped in a self-destructive consumer society. But, this was not how Hip-Hop was in the beginning. This powerful tool was a voice to allow the disenfranchised people of the inner cities to be heard. 

Life Convicts like others mark a serious return to these conscious roots; a tool of education and empowerment.

This is their debut album, and they continue to develop new Palestine-related tracks

After weeks of Israeli closure, Gaza Strip is completely out of bread 
 
     
 Dear Friends,
 
The Israeli government convinced many people that it ""gave Gaza back to the Palestinians"" a few months ago, but as the report below demonstrates, Israel still controls the people in Gaza, and now it is making them go without bread¡ªliterally. Gaza is not free; it is a huge prison controlled by Israel.
 
As long as there is a Jewish state in Palestine, Zionist leaders will subject non-Jews to racist policies like this. These policies are necessary because a Jewish state¡ªin order to ""secure"" a Jewish majority population¡ªneeds to drive non-Jews out of the Jewish state part of Palestine and forcibly prevent them from returning to their country, all of which requires brutal measures to control Palestinians. The atrocities that Israel now commits in its occupation of the West Bank and control of Gazan borders are, as Israel says, security measures; the point is that they are designed to make secure that which should be abolished¡ªa racist state (Israel itself, not just its occupation of the territories) based on oppression of and discrimination against non-Jews in ways that top South African trade unionist Willy Madisha, president of  COSATU, said made South Africa's apartheid policies a ""sunday picnic"" in comparison.

WeAreChange.org News reporting from the Live Free or Die concert. Dave Cahill playing and Randy Weaver's speech along with childish antics by Homeland Security.

WeAreChange.org attended the Live Free or Die Concert at Ed and Elaine Brown's house in Plainfield, New Hampshire. Upon entering the property it was observed that a couple of local police were monitoring Center of Town Road. They waived at us as we drove through at about noon. They certainly didn't seem to care about our safety by warning us of some danger ahead, but rather tipped their hat so to speak as we drove by. How can the Plainfield Police say that they would refuse to send in emergency medical care because of the danger but not warn traveler's on the road?

The whole day was very festive with many bands and speakers filling the day's event. It would have been perfect if not for the homeland security helicopter buzzing around the entire day. However, most attendees were unaffected by the annoying sounds of the ""Homeland Insecurity"" chopper. In fact the net effect of this childish antic was to further consolidate the truth that Homeland Security is the new Gestapo more concerned with freedom loving Americans than protecting our borders. How many potential enemy of the states could have been stopped that day by flying the border instead of annoying concert goers.

Chris DeBurgh - Lady In Red

I've never seen you looking so lovely 
as you did tonight 
I've never seen you 
shine so bright 
I've never seen so many men 
ask you if you wanted to dance 
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance 
I have never seen that dress you're wearing 
Or the highlights in your 
head that catch your eyes 
I have been blind 

The lady in red is dancing 
with me cheek to cheek 
There's nobody here, 
it's just you and me, 
It's where I wanna be 
But I hardly know this 
beauty by my side 
I'll never for get, 
the way you look tonight 

I've never seen you looking 
so gorgeous as you did tonight 
I've never seen you shine 
so bright you were amazing 
I've never seen so many people 
want to be there by your side 
And when you turned to 
me and smiled, It took my breath away 
I have never had such a feeling 
Such a feeling of complete 
and utter love, as I do tonight 

The way you look tonight 
I never will forget, the way you look tonight 
The lady in red 
The lady in red 
The lady in red 
My lady in red

Lyrics:

Seems like only yesterday
Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see, no looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black

Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore
Desperate meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done

I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

So I tried to find my way
Spinning I was in a daze
Burning like a flame behind my eyes
Drown it out drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner slave to the disguise

Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye

I lay there in the dark I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
No reason left for me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive

Come alive (9 times)

I lay there in the dark I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Come alive (15 times)

Nothing more to give
i can finally, come alive.
your life into me
i can finally breathe, come alive..
I lay there in the dark I open my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive 
Come alive (7 times)",734044,668,,157,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDQIGu6oPHM,https://archive.org/details/youtube-KDQIGu6oPHM

Lyrics:
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load

Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse

Can't contain him
He knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Talking Heads was an American rock band that formed in the early 1970s and was based out of New York City. The group consisted of David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison. During later stages of the band's tenure, a number of auxiliary musicians were brought in on keyboards, percussion, backing vocals, secondary bass guitar and other instruments.

Talking Heads sound combined punk rock, pop, funk rock, art rock, and later in their career, world music. In David Byrne, they had one of the most distinctive front men of the period; they were extremely popular while they were originally together, and continue to influence many musicians to this day. Their concert film Stop Making Sense is acclaimed by many as one of the finest examples of the genre.",145272,431,,78,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87eY75_TZVw,https://archive.org/details/youtube-87eY75_TZVw

Question: Are we allowed to buy items from Israeli sources, even though this money may be used to help the Jewish ""war machine""?

Answer by Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi:

It is Jihad to liberate the Islamic lands from those who attack or conquer them. These are enemies of Islam. This Jihad is an absolute obligation and a sacred duty; firstly on the people of that land. If the Muslims of that land can't offer sufficientresistance, then Muslims of neighboring countries are obliged to assist. If this is still not sufficient then all the Muslims of the world must assist.

Palestine is the land of the first Qiblah of the Muslims, the land of Isra' and Mi`raj, the land of Al-Aqsa and the blessed territory. The conquerors are those with the greatest enmity to the believers, and they are supported by the strongest state on earth - the USA, and by the world Jewish community.

Jihad is obligatory against those who take land and expel the inhabitants, spill the blood, violate the honor, destroy thehouses, burn the fields, and corrupt the land. Jihad is the first obligation of all obligations, and the first duty of the Ummah. Muslims are commanded to do this, first those from the land in question, after that their neighbors, and finally all Muslims. We must all be united against the aggressors. We are united in Islam, including unity of belief in the Shari`ah, unity of belief in the Qiblah, and also united in pain and hope. As Allah Almighty says: ""Verily this Ummah of yours is one Ummah."" (Qur'an, 21:92). Allah Almighty also says: ""Surely the believers are a single brotherhood."" (Qur'an, 49:10). There is a Hadith of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, that states: ""The Muslim is the brother to the Muslim, he can't oppress him, he can't give him up, he can't let him down."" [Transmitted by Muslim].

Now we see our brothers and children in Al-Aqsa and the blessed land of Palestine generously sacrificing their blood, giving their souls willingly in the way of Allah. All Muslims must help them with whatever power they have. (See the Noble Qur'an, 8:72).

If people ask in the name of religion we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham ...etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them.

American goods, exactly like ""Israeli"" goods, are forbidden. It is also forbidden to advertise these goods. America today is a second Israel. It totally supports the Zionist entity. The usurper could not do this without the support of America. ""Israel's"" unjustified destruction and vandalism of everything has been using American money, American weapons, and the American veto. America has done this for decades without suffering the consequences of any punishment or protests about their oppressive and prejudiced position from the Islamic world.

The time has come for the Islamic Ummah to say ""NO"" to America, ""NO"" to its companies, and ""NO"" to its goods, which swamp our markets. We are eating, drinking, wearing and riding whatever America produces.

`Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ""You have three enemies; your enemy, the friend of your enemy, and the enemy of your friend"". The USA today is more than friends to our enemy; they would destroy themselves for Israel. The world wide Muslim Ummah numbering 1.3 billion, could cause pain to the USA and its companies by boycotting them. This is an obligation of our religion, and the way of Allah. Every Muslim that buys ""Israeli"" or American goods, when there is an alternative from other countries is committing a haram act. They are clearly committing a major sin, which is a crime against Allah's law, which invokes punishment from Allah, and the contempt of the people.

Our brothers in ""Israel"" and America are forced to deal with them and buy their products. Allah does not ask you to do what you can't do; only what you can.

Allah says: ""Fear Allah as much as you are able."" (Qur'an, 64:16).

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: ""If I order you to do something, do however much you can"". Muslims in America must work with companies who are least hostile to Muslims, least allied to the Zionists. Boycott Zionist companies as much as you can

Dear Friends,
The "" Bert Salzman collection of classic 16mm educational films have recently been saved from extinction and are now available for viewing on the Internet Archive. Link: http://www.archive.org/search.php?que...

The films originally made in the early 1970's as human values films for social study classes include the (Academy Award winner Angel And Big Joe and Geronimo Jones (which premiered at the famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City). In his films Bert Salzman tries to instill hope and love into the hearts of young people. His message always was: ""Have hope, go deep into your self; You are more than you think you are!"".

The Internet Academic Archive is now hosting all of the Bert Salzman Collection and links to the entire collection can be found below. If you enjoy these films please forward this letter to your friends especially educators. From the beginning It has always been Bert's dream, his goal- that his films find their way into every school in this very troubled world and perhaps change it for the better-even in a small way. Bert thanks you in advance for your help in achieving this goal.

Origin Of films: ***
The early to mid-1970s were truly heady times for the educational film world. Fueled by the Johnson administration's ""Great Society"" philosophy, educational programs embraced themes of ethnic awareness and diversity, and school districts nationwide began demanding professional quality 16mm films that both encouraged and provoked classroom discussion. Learning Corporation of America, was a prime source for these types of films, and the maker of several of its most profound and dynamic films was Bert Salzman. Salzman was already a successful artist before embarking on a career as a filmmaker. In 1970, Linda Gottlieb of LCA asked him to choose three ethnic groups as focal points for his first LCA films. The films he did for LCA eventually ran to eight, including Oscar-winning Angel & Big Joe. Salzman infused each of these films which he wrote and directed with elements essential to great film of any genre: pathos, passion, and humor.

A young Apache boy is torn between the traditions of his heritage and the challenging life led by his cousin, who left the reservation to become an astronomer. The boy is also faced with deciding whether to keep a tribal artifact from his grandfather or trade it for a new TV. He does the latter in order to buy a birthday present for the grandfather. However, when Geronimo turns on the TV, the two are instantly reminded of the relationship of the Native American to contemporary society.  A beautifuly touching story about a native American boy. Young Geronimo Jones is caught between his past and his future. Beautifully shot on the Papogo Indian reservation in Arizona. Well acted and a fantastic and most touching story! Don't miss it.

God of Justice; Thou who saved us
When in deepest bondage cast,
Hear our voices, we entreat Thee,
Be our leader as in the past.

With Thy mighty hand guide, defend
Of the Serbian future pace,
God of justice, save and nourish
Serbian lands and Serbian race!

Bind in closest links our kindred
Teach the love that will not fail,
May the loathed fiend of discord
Never in our ranks prevail.

Let the golden fruits of union
Flourish with the freedom grace;
God of justice, guide and prosper
Serbian lands and Serbian race!

Lord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,
Thunder of Thy dreaded ire;
Bless each Serbian town and hamlet,
Mountain, meadow, heart and spire.

When our host goes forth to battle
Death or victory to embrace-
God of armies! be our leader
Strengthen then the Serbian race!

On our sepulchre of ages
Breaks the resurrection morn,
From the slough of direst slavery
Serbia anew is born.

T' Serbian home-land Thou shalt nourish,
Five cent'ries a battle place,
God of Justice! Guide and prosper,
Thus entreats the Serbian race!",34817,151,,27,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u_Bt4iqWTk,https://archive.org/details/youtube-5u_Bt4iqWTk

AYmWPaxs3PY,The X-Ray Cafe (1 of 3),OttOmOlOtOv,"['X-Ray', 'Cafe', 'Punk', 'Rock', 'Anarchy', 'Dada', 'Club', 'Riot', 'Situationist', 'Portland', 'Oregon']",2007-09-18T03:38:55Z,PT9M35S,"In October of 1990 the small space at 214 W. Burnside was still known as the UFO Caf¨¦, owned by a thickly-accented Greek named Alkis. Unorthodox and adventurous in his musical tastes, Alkis hoped to increase his pizza sales by allowing a local band named The Kurtz Project to perform regularly and book other bands. Unbeknownst to the musicians and patrons, however, Alkis had been equally adventurous in his financial strategies. Some months earlier, in an inspired effort to decrease his overhead, he had also hit on the idea of discontinuing his rent payments.

In the inevitable collapse that soon followed, Alkis vacated, and two members of the house band, Benjamin Arthur Ellis and Tres Shannon, somehow emerged from the wreckage holding the lease. With no experience running a club, the pair set about transforming a hole-in-the-wall pizzeria into Portland's primary all-ages hole-in-the-wall music venue.

What was quickly christened the X-Ray Caf¨¦ soon featured blocked windows with cheerful signage handpainted above them. Underneath the building's gutted upper stories and rusted fire escape, the street-level exterior was whitewashed, and a mural was painted low along the sidewalk. The interior was furnished through a constant influx of thrifting scores, dumpster dives, and personal belongings. The walls were eventually hung with dozens of frustratingly memorable velvet paintings.

In hindsight, the timing of the X-Ray's birth was perfect. While grunge and alternative music were exploding in Seattle and a low-fi revolution was mounting in Olympia, the X-Ray, and nearby Satyricon, provided much-needed stages for smaller acts, and were crucial in establishing Portland as an important regional destination for touring bands. Both clubs also formed cradles for emerging Portland musicians, but it was the X-Ray that was far more fluid, encouraging, and open to the bizarre. Local bands Crackerbash, Pond, Hazel, Smegma, Poison Idea, Dead Moon, Hitting Birth, New Bad Things, Last Pariahs, Motorgoat (which became Quasi), and the Spinanes alternated with visits from Beat Happening, Unwound, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, Hole, Sunny Day Real Estate, and Green Day.

Although it hosted an average of three or four bands a night, less than half of the X-Ray's operating hours were actually devoted to live music. Necessity and boredom fueled an endless succession of theme nights and ""educational"" afternoons. Sleepovers, Spanish lessons, drum and sewing circles, science and electronics lessons, and Q&A sessions about nothing in particular were regularly offered. Ellis and Shannon were open to virtually any community-minded event as long they didn't have to organize it.",16205,93,,17,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYmWPaxs3PY,https://archive.org/details/youtube-AYmWPaxs3PY

Those familiar with the X-Ray invariably recall at least a few recurring characters who contributed their unique pathologies to the area's already rich pageantry. In time, some were given chores, and the chores eventually became unofficial jobs. Bands loading into the club for the first time would tread very carefully, unsure how to deal with these obnoxious patrons who seemed to move about with the casual confidence of long-time staff.

Frequent attendees were also a part of the X-Ray experience. Teenagers suspended in underage purgatory could be spotted in the crowd night after night. Like the ""helpful"" regulars, some of the most constant were eventually drafted into the staff. Familiar faces were such an important element of the X-Ray that when road trips were organized to Olympia and Eugene, a small army of regulars was enlisted to accompany the acts on the bill.

The jury-rigged environment, all-ages status, and enthusiastic crowd of frequently unstable regulars functioned like a filter. The X-Ray never felt ""cool"" like Satyricon felt cool. Hanging out solely to project an image was problematic at the X-Ray. Besides the fact that there was no bar and no alcohol, awkward (and often strongly scented) reality tended to intrude. It's hard to maintain aloof detachment when you've become the sole focus of a towering Elvis impersonator with a matted beard and dizzyingly thick lenses in his busted frames. The most studied, cultivated fa?ade was no match for interpretive dancers flailing about on the floor two feet away. If you considered the X-Ray ""hip,"" your definition of the word was necessarily broader than the fashionable, ironic, and smug.",10057,33,,4,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp-YuuHSg88&pp=ygUXVGhlIFgtUmF5IENhZmUgKDIgb2YgMyk%3D,https://archive.org/details/youtube-qp-YuuHSg88

No one was watching out of the corner of his or her eye to see whether you smiled or sulked. No one asked anything of you, except perhaps a moderate effort toward the physical safety of others. It was possible to walk through the door on an empty, late afternoon and curl up asleep against the far wall. Someone would greet you as you entered and then go back to sweeping the floors or fixing the sound system or painting the ceiling.

Before Portland had Reading Frenzy, the X-Ray served as a common distribution point for event flyers and the early output of the small-press and zine community. Its do-it-yourself attitude was a catalyst that trained sound technicians, inspired future business owners, and introduced organizers and activists to one another. Relationships both romantic and practical were initiated and still flourish.

It was also generally understood that simply by virtue of its presence and popularity, the X-Ray provided de facto services and protection for a number of homeless, at-risk youths. And at a time when national needle-exchange programs were struggling to prove their worth, the X-Ray stepped forward and became the first satellite exchange in Portland.

The X-Ray lasted until August of 1994, when Ben and Tres retired it voluntarily in the face of an uncertain future filled with certain debts. In the end, fundraisers and round-the-clock marathon shows weren't enough to balance mounting bills and exhaustion. After one last legendary, exultant, and emotional night, the X-Ray closed. The space was handed over to a small handful of regulars who transformed it into an outlet for second-hand clothing, punk rock records, and cheap food.",5783,34,,13,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSXz8MiF1sA,https://archive.org/details/youtube-lSXz8MiF1sA

When a phone won't work, Angel enlists ""Big Joe's"" aid to repair it and from then on a friendship develops. Joe and the boy team up to start a rose-growing business. A call from Angel's father comes, the family must leave. Angel can stay with Joe and the promise of a future, or he can go with his family and continue in the uncertain lifestyle of his parents. ANGEL is about realities that are always important to human beings--friendship, family, ambition, loyalty, dreams--this film will never grow old. While it may be of interest to scholars and historians, this short movie will surely be valued by ""ordinary"" people who simply love to watch great movies. ANGEL AND BIG JOE is excellent in every way a movie can stand out: story, characterizations, dialogue, acting, cinematography, locations, music, editing.

Dear Friends,
The Bert Salzman collection of classic 16mm educational films have recently been saved from extinction and are now available for viewing on the Internet Archive. Link: http://www.archive.org/search.php?que...

The films originally made in the early 1970's as human values films for social study classes include the (Academy Award winner Angel And Big Joe and Geronimo Jones (which premiered at the famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City). In his films Bert Salzman tries to instill hope and love into the hearts of young people. His message always was: ""Have hope, go deep into your self; You are more than you think you are!"".

The Internet Academic Archive is now hosting all of the Bert Salzman Collection and links to the entire collection can be found below. If you enjoy these films please forward this letter to your friends especially educators. From the beginning It has always been Bert's dream, his goal- that his films find their way into every school in this very troubled world and perhaps change it for the better-even in a small way. Bert thanks you in advance for your help in achieving this goal.

The films he did for LCA eventually ran to eight, including Oscar-winning Angel & Big Joe. Salzman infused each of these films which he wrote and directed with elements essential to great film of any genre: pathos, passion, and humor.

Matthew's Uncle Isak comes to visit the family in Anchorage after undergoing harsh and unfruitful hunting conditions in the North. Uncle Isak's challenges in dealing with a more structured urban environment presents a problem for he and family. The story is poignant especially when told by the real native American Eskimo's in the film; at these times the faces of the narrators reveal their sorrow and unease even more than their words. Matthew unselfishly helps his uncle reclaim his lost dignity. A very moving story! And a model for young people. Awards: Midwest Film Festival Merit Award; Alaska Council of Arts Award.

Lyrics

Verse 1

I see no, hear no evil
Black writings on the wall
Unleash a million faces
And one by one they fall

Black hearted evil
Brave hearted hero
I am all... I am all... I am

I... I... I... I am

Here we go buddy... Here we go buddy... Here we go
Here we go buddy... Here we go

Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare
One step forward, two steps back
I'm here (One step forward, two steps back)

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life

Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all... I am all of me
(I am... I am all of me)

I am... I am... I'm all of me
I am... I am... I'm all of me
I am... I am... I'm all of me

Here we go... go... go... 
Go... go... go... go...
All of me

Verse 2

I see and feel the evil
My hands will crush 'em all
You think you have the answer
Well I laugh and watch you fall

Black hearted evil
Brave hearted hero
I am all... I am all... I am

I... I... I... I am

Here we go buddy... Here we go buddy... Here we go
Here we go buddy... Here we go

Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare
One step forward, two steps back
I'm here (One step forward, two steps back)

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life

Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all... I am all of me
(I am... I am all of me)

I am... I am... I'm all of me
I am... I am... I'm all of me

Here we go... go... go...
Go... Go... Go... Go...

I am; I am everyone; everywhere, anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am; I am everyone, everywhere, anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am... I am... I am...
I am... I am... I am...

I am...

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life

Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
(I am... I am all of me)

I am... I am... I'm all of me
I am... I am... I'm all of me
I am I am... I'm all of me

Mario Savio 
The man who told us that ""sometimes, when the machine becomes so odious, it makes us sick. And at that point, we have to put our entire bodies against the gears and the wheels and the levers. Against the entire apparatus, and we have to make it stop. And that we have to say to those who own the machine, that unless we're free, we'll prevent the machine from working at all. I put my entire body against the gears and the wheels and the levers--against the entire apparatus of the machine. And I tried to stop it.""
-
Senator Barry Goldwater, a believer in UFO's, lamented that, try as he might, he did not have a high enough clearance as an Air Force Reserve General to get into Hamilton Air Force Base in Ohio to check out certain UFO specimens said to be held there. Robert Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were reputed to be fascinated by the field. For Marrs, a veteran investigator with far more experience in the field than you possess, to delve into this area among others is not surprising at all. To dismiss everything he might say or write in any other field because of this is anti-intellectualism to a sad and dangerous degree.

An investigator is always willing to look at the facts if investigation is the true goal. In this instance it appears to be a case of ego enhancement to the extent of ""I'm right and that is that!""

A government-owned corporation, state-owned enterprise or government business enterprise is a legal entity created by a government to undertake commercial or business activities on behalf of an owner government. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used inter-changeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, SOEs should be differentiated from other forms of government corporation or entity established to pursue purely non-financial objectives that have no need or goal of satisfying the shareholders with return on their investment through price increase or dividends.

Lyrics are:
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories 
Where everything 
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
Now and then when I see her face 
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long 
I'd probably break down and cry 


Sweet child o' mine 
Sweet love of mine 


She's got eyes of the bluest skies 
As if they thought of rain 
I hate to look into those eyes 
And see an ounce of pain 
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
Where as a child I'd hide 
And pray for the thunder 
And the rain 
To quietly pass me by


Sweet child o' mine 
Sweet love of mine 


Where do we go 
Where do we go now 
Where do we go 
Sweet child o' mine",15696,61,,28,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0U1iyUVqG0,https://archive.org/details/youtube-f0U1iyUVqG0

Lyrics:
I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

He has also released a number of solo albums for Island Records and Atlantic Records, and has worked with many other musicians. He was nominated for a Grammy in 2005 for his single Beat Box Guitar, in the category Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In addition, Belew is well-regarded for his contributions, particularly on guitar, to various other artists' recordings. In 1977, he performed with Frank Zappa, appearing in Zappa's 1979 concert film Baby Snakes, as well as Zappa's controversial album Sheik Yerbouti, where Belew provides the memorable and scathing impersonation of Bob Dylan on the song Flakes. Belew played guitar in David Bowie's band on the 'Stage' world tour in 1978, and the following year contributed lead guitar parts on his Lodger album. In 1990 he acted as musical director on Bowie's 'Sound + Vision' tour as well as providing guitar/backing vocals.

Belew's other session credits include the 1980 album Remain in Light by the Talking Heads, Lights Out by Peter Wolf, Earth Moving by Mike Oldfield and Paul Simon's landmark 1986 album Graceland. He worked with Laurie Anderson during the mid-1980s, appearing in her concert film Home of the Brave. He also worked with the Tom Tom Club on their first album in 1981. He contributed to a Ryuichi Sakamoto album called Lefthanded Dream in 1981, together with Robin Scott of the pop group ""M"". During the 1990s, he contributed to two Nine Inch Nails albums, The Downward Spiral and The Fragile. He played synthesized guitar on the song God Shuffled His Feet by Crash Test Dummies in 1993. In 1995 he produced two tracks on Jars of Clay's debut album, including the crossover Christian hit ""Flood"".

In the late 80s, Belew formed the pop band The Bears with ex-members of The Raisins (a Cincinnati-based band that had some local success in the early 1980s), and released two albums, The Bears and Rise and Shine. A third album, Car Caught Fire, followed in 2001. The Bears released their fourth studio album, Eureka, early in 2007.

He is featured prominently on Tori Amos's 2001 album of cover versions, Strange Little Girls. He also contributed his lead guitar stylings to Porcupine Tree's album, Deadwing (2005) as well as to a track I Can't Get Behind That, (also featuring Henry Rollins) on the 2004 Ben Folds-produced William Shatner album Has Been.

He is featured as ""primary guitarist"" on the album Habitat by progressive rock band Man on Fire.

He even appeared in a series of Japanese advertisements promoting the mechanic company Daikin in which he emulated animal noises with his electric guitar and appeared as the conductor, conducting a symphony in which all the members were himself playing guitar.

Belew's vocals are known for their distinct, sometimes manic feel - his singing voice is often compared to that of Talking Heads singer David Byrne. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he played on one Talking Heads album and toured with them in 1980 before being invited to join King Crimson. While with King Crimson Robert Fripp considered replacing him with David Sylvian in the early 1990s, but Sylvian declined the offer


Current - 2006/2007
In April/May 2006, Adrian toured Australia with local musicians Al Slavik (bass guitar, stick and vocals) and John Prior from Matt Finish (drums).

Adrian is currently touring the U.S. with his latest band, The Adrian Belew Trio, which is rounded out by former Paul Green School of Rock students Eric Slick (20) on drums and Julie Slick (21) on bass. In August of 2006 in Atlanta, Georgia he performed on The Acoustic Planet Tour with Bela Fleck & The Flecktones and Umphrey's McGee, and the trio are currently recording Side Four, a live album compiled from their recent and upcoming tours.

King Crimson also has tentative plans to rehearse in September 2007 for a possible new record and/or tour.[citation needed]

An unborn baby's heart starts to beat at 18 days after conception. She has fingers and toes at 5 to 6 weeks. Most abortions occur at 7 weeks. There have been almost 50 million abortions since 1973....millions of beating hearts have been stopped and millions of women's hearts have been wounded forever. May those who watch this video reconsider the choice of abortion.,11709,34,,17,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek95GAtNYzM,https://archive.org/details/youtube-Ek95GAtNYzM

Harmonie L'Union speelde twee avonden voor het publiek muziek van zeer uiteenlopende genres. Het programma was een mix van moderne pop, classics, filmmuziek, disco, musicals en dansmuziek en herkenbare symfonische muziekwerken. 

Het combo bestond uit Tom Brouwer (toetsen) Luuk Smets / Michiel Vromans (drums) Jac Knook (basgitaar) en Pieter van Helden (gitaar). Tachtig muzikanten begeleidde de vier vocalisten bij hun optredens.

Voor dit prom concert waren de solisten Karin Heeren, Dorien Driessens, Bas Soetens en Stephan Beerens uitgenodigd om het enthousiaste promspubliek mee te nemen bij bekende hits. Meezingen, dansen en uit je ""dak gaan"" in een sfeervol ingerichte proms-zaal kwamen steeds naar voren. De vette lichtshow en grote videowall maken het geheel perfect af. 

Een van de hoofdacts werd het optreden van Jasper van Rosmalen (Marco Borsato). Op zijn viool speelde hij meesterlijke melodi?n die het publiek diep hebben geroerd. 

De reacties van de gasten waren overweldigend. Alle mensen, de muzikanten, solisten; iedereen was lovend over dit geweldige muziek spectakel...

Auf der Welt gibt's viele L?nder
und gib auch dies eine Land
und die Menschen, die hier leben
sind vereint in Gotteshand.

Heimat die keiner Andern gleicht
Heimat so tief die Sehnsucht geht
Heimat die f¨¹r uns alle steht.

Von den schneebedeckten Bergen
bis zum wei?en Meeresstrand
Jeden der hier wohnt verbindet
dieses eine starke Band.

Heimat so weit das Auge reicht,
Heimat die keiner Andern gleicht
Heimat die in den Herzen wohnt
Heimat die jedes Opfer lohnt.

Und wenn dir dein Leben mal schwer f?llt
das Gl¨¹ck gerade anderswo ist
dann ?ffne Herz und Augen

This is a song Ive found when I watched Spongebob lol...
So I made lyrics for it...
- I made some misstakes in my Lyrics..

Here you can see the correct Lyrics:

The winner takes all
Its the thrill of one more kill
the last on to fall will never sacrifice their will
dont ever look back on the world closing in
be on the attack with your wings on the wind
the games will begin
Sweet Victory
Its ours for the taking its ours for the fight
Sweet Victory
And the one who's last to fall
The winner takes all
You don't win no silver
You only lose the gold
You push with a fever for your time keeps tolling on
Against all the odds, against all your pain your backs on the wall with no one to blame
Wild hearts won't be tamed
(Sweet Victory Chorus)
And the one who's last to fall, the winner takes all...solo
And the one who's last to fall yeah
(Sweet Victory Chorus)
And the one who's last to fall

Can you visualize the consequences that we patronise
But it's alright, you're too far gone, just realize
Taste the spice of life and you'll feel fine, together we can climb
But it's alright, there's nothing there, did you realize
Chorus 1:
Yeah my placebo will put you in Disneyland
We'll be in heaven, it will make your mind expand
Yeah my placebo, unreality overrides
We'll be in limbo for the rest of our lives
Rise above yourself, get higher, feel on fire, your desire will mesmerize,
But it's alright, you electrify, it's getting hot
For the circular cosmic spot, it's getting too hot
Chorus 2:
Yeah my placebo will put you in Disneyland
We'll be in heaven, it will make your mind expand
Yeah my placebo, unreality overrides
We'll be in limbo for the rest of our lives
Take a look at what you are, you can't ignore the fact it's dying
Take at look at who you are, I can't disguise the fact I'm trying
I know that we're too far gone, just realize it won't take long
Every man and woman is a star tonight
And time and time again nothing makes sense
And time and time again nothing relents
And time and time again now it's alright
Cause time and time again it's outta sight.

Following the many progressions of Meat Beat over the years has been a great musical adventure. Unlike other bands that might lose it, Meat Beat continues to flourish and has produced a large collection of musical wonders, entrancing beats in conjunction with great lyrics, and stellar samples. 

It is certain that Jack Dangers is the master mind of MBM, but there is much more to it than that. MBM is a mighty conglomeration made up of many contributing parties over the years. All facets are important in sculpting this special gem of musical ingenuity.

WE DO NOT HAVE A FREE PRESS

""The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes."" ~ John Swinton

This musical conception combines the philosophy and techniques of minimalism with Asian and African styles, and relies heavily on the use of electronic instruments. Critics of Hassell's style have noted its incorporation of New Age and world music styles, but have also detected the influence of Miles Davis, particularly Davis' use of electronics, modal harmony and understated lyricism.Both on record and during live performances, Hassell makes use of traditional western instruments--keyboards, bass, electric guitar, and percussion--to create modal, hypnotic grooves, over which he plays microtonally-inflected trumpet phrases in the style of Nath's kiranic vocals

Zwart als ravenveren

Tijdens een nacht zwart als raven veren, De wind snijdt door merg en been, De sneeuw is hard bevroren, En het water hard als steen

In de heilige winterwouden, Waagt niemand zich nog alleen, De stilte regeert over de velden, Bij die oude eik kwam eens het ding bijeen 

Het vuur vreet van het droge hout, 
Verhalen die gaan in het rond, In de warmte van de hoeve, Wordt gewacht op de morgenstond

Runen geritst in bijlblad en zwaard
De goden om bijstand verzocht, Morgen de laatste kans op vergelding, Tot de zege of tot de laatste ademtocht

Op een koude wintermorgen, Slagordes aan Wodan gewijd, Geen verzaakt de oude gebruiken, Het laatste verzet van de heiden tijd 

Twee raven zweven nog hoog over de bomen, Krassend doorklieven ze de lucht, De oude gebruiken bijna vergeten, Het is hun laatste rondvlucht, Tijdens een nacht zwart als raven veren...",20162,107,,13,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl0LWw_9CAA,https://archive.org/details/youtube-bl0LWw_9CAA

Orchestra Barred from Entering Gaza by Israeli Military Performs Solidarity Concert in Ramallah
Palestine Monitor 
17 December 2007
Ramallah, 17-12-07: The international orchestra which refused to perform in the Gaza Strip yesterday after its sole Palestinian member, violinist Ramzi Aburedwan, was barred from entering the Strip by the Israeli authorities, performed a concert in solidarity with the people of Gaza from Ramallah today.

The orchestra had been due to perform at the Latin Church in Gaza City yesterday as part of a Baroque Music Festival which is taking place throughout Palestine and Israel.

Crazy Collage brings to light the little we know about the details of the Hidden Truth behind the Skull Bones and the truth about aliens on this planet, we are not alone as The Disclosure Project with Doctor Steven Greer explains

In 1993, Dr. Greer gave up his private life and a lucrative medical practice in order to bring to the world information that had remained hidden until his courageous efforts brought it to light.

The Project involved gaining the recorded and transcribed testimony of scores of certain scientists, government officials, airline pilots, military personnel, and others who all have one thing in common. They all have first-hand knowledge concerning contacts by the American and other governments with extraterrestrial beings, vehicles (UFOs), and ¡ª of particular interest to this month's Spirit of Ma'at ¡ª alien technology.

""There have been multiple events,"" the report reads, ""at least a couple of dozen, where objects of extraterrestrial origin have been downed, acquired, and studied.

""We believe that this is something which is of extreme importance because one cannot consider that covert programs ¡ª having spent hundreds of billions of dollars over the decades on research and development, so-called ""reverse engineering"" or ""back engineering"" extraterrestrial technologies ¡ª have not had significant breakthroughs.

""The testimony will show that in fact we have; that we have had breakthroughs that have trickled out to our society in the form of certain advances in electronics, materials, and sciences.

""However, the central breakthrough dealing with the physics of the quantum vacuum space ¡ª the so-called ""zero-point energy"" phenomenon, as well as antigravity and electrogravitic propulsion ¡ª has been withheld from our society.""

A little-known fact unites Democratic frontrunner John Kerry and President Bush: they are both members of Yale's secret society Skull and Bones. We speak with the author of ""Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power"" that reveals details about the secret society and its members. 

The New Hampshire primary is just a few days away and Howard Dean's status as the frontrunner has almost totally dissipated. The latest Boston Herald poll now shows that John Kerry holds a 10 point lead - a major surge for the Massachusetts Senator. Still reeling from his victory in Iowa, Kerry is starting to act like the frontrunner, shifting his focus from comparing himself to the other Democrats to putting his record up against President George W. Bush, saying he is the only candidate who can beat Bush and who represents a real difference from the current occupant of the White House. 

But there is a fact about Kerry's past that brings him closer to Bush than any of the other candidates. Both Bush and Kerry are members of a secretive society dating back to their respective days at Yale University - Skull and Bones. This fact has not been widely reported but when Kerry's campaign spokesperson was asked about it, she said, ""John Kerry has absolutely nothing to say on that subject. Sorry.""

""I must admit that I have been deeply shocked by a story that appeared today on my website, to the effect that the BBC reported the collapse of WTC Building 7 23 minutes before it actually took place. Previously, the BBC claimed that it had lost all of its 9/11 coverage, but this video has now surfaced. I watched it myself, and sat there with my blood literally running cold as I saw their reporter saying that Building 7 had collapsed while it was still visible behind her, perfectly intact. 
Now, why wasn't this just a simple mistake? CNN was reporting rumors that Building 7 might be about to collapse an hour before it happened. 

But the BBC reporter is clearly seen reading from a teleprompter. Obviously, she was reading something written on it, and not making up what would have then seemed to be a wild tale. In other words, she was reading a script, and that script had been put up on her teleprompter early. Not only that, she was sitting in front of a live image of the still-intact Building 7.
Somebody wrote that script and did so while Building 7 was still standing. How could they know that it would collapse, even if it was unstable, even if there was a fire in the cellars?"" - Whitley Strieber
